# FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Scorecard

A library to quantify FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) standards for research software by leveraging FAIR4RS Principles and expanding these principles to more systematically measure and enhance the FAIR alignment of models. The tool will not only assess how the research software aligns with the quality compliance scorecard, but also offer practical solutions to researchers, facilitating the development and reuse of their models and high-performance computing environments in research.
