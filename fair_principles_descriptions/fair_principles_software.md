### FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS)

**Source:** Barker, M. et al. *Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software* (2022).

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Findable** | **Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find.** |
| F1 | Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. |
| F1.1 | Components of the software representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers. |
| F1.2 | Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers. |
| F2 | Software is described with rich metadata. |
| F3 | Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe. |
| F4 | Metadata are FAIR, searchable and indexable. |
| **Accessible** | **Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardized protocols.** |
| A1 | Software and its metadata are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol. |
| A1.1 | The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable. |
| A1.2 | The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary. |
| A2 | Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available. |
| **Interoperable** | **Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.** |
| I1 | Software reads, writes and exchanges data in a way that meets domain-relevant community standards. |
| I2 | Software includes qualified references to other objects. |
| **Reusable** | **Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).** |
| R1 | Software is described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes. |
| R1.1 | Software is given a clear and accessible license. |
| R1.2 | Software is associated with detailed provenance. |
| R2 | Software includes qualified references to other software. |
| R3 | Software meets domain-relevant community standards. |
