### FAIR Principles for Computational Workflows

**Source:** Wilkinson, S. R. et al. *Applying the FAIR Principles to computational workflows* (2025).

| Principle | Description | Based on (Data/Software) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Findable** |  |  |
| F1 | A workflow is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. | D-F1 and S-F1 |
| F1.1 | Components of the workflow representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers. | S-F1.1 |
| F1.2 | Different versions of the workflow are assigned distinct identifiers. | S-F1.2 |
| F2 | A workflow and its components are described with rich metadata. | D-F2 and S-F2 |
| F3 | Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the workflow, and workflow versions, that they describe. | D-F3 and S-F3 |
| F4 | Metadata and workflow are registered or indexed in a searchable FAIR resource. | D-F4 and S-F4 |
| **Accessible** |  |  |
| A1 | Workflow and its components are retrievable by their identifiers using a standardized communications protocol. | D-A1 and S-A1 |
| A1.1 | The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable. | D-A1.1 and S-A1.1 |
| A1.2 | The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, when necessary. | D-A1.2 and S-A1.2 |
| A2 | Metadata are accessible, even when the workflow is no longer available. | D-A2 and S-A2 |
| **Interoperable** |  |  |
| I1 | Workflow is described using a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. | D-I1 |
| I2 | Workflow uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles. | D-I2 |
| I3 | Workflow includes qualified references to other (meta)data, environments, and other objects. | D-I3 and S-I2 |
| I3.1 | Workflow includes qualified references to other components including child workflows. | D-I3 and S-R2 |
| **Reusable** |  |  |
| R1 | Workflow and its components are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes. | D-R1 and S-R1 |
| R1.1 | Workflow and its components are released with a clear and accessible usage license. | D-R1.1 and S-R1.1 |
| R1.2 | Workflow is associated with detailed provenance. | D-R1.2 and S-R1.2 |
| R1.3 | Workflow meets domain-relevant community standards. | D-R1.3 and S-R3 |
