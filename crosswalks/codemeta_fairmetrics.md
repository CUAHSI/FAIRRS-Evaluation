# Codemeta and FAIR4RS Metrics Crosswalks

The following table shows the crosswalk between [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/terms/) terms and the FAIR for Research Software metrics. The Metric IDs and Short Descriptions are based on documents available at [FAIRMetrics](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/Distributions) repository.
