  "abstract": "The Upper Floridan aquifer underlying the Suwannee River Basin in Florida has experienced increased groundwater pumping and nitrate leaching over the last half century resulting in violation of water quantity and quality standards, largely due to row crop production. Increasingly carrot is being added as a winter cash crop to the traditional corn-peanut rotation in the region which may further increase pumping and nitrogen leaching. Establishing carrot nitrogen and irrigation best management practices is therefore critical to help growers meet yield goals while minimizing groundwater quantity and quality impacts. In this study, a carrot cultivation field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of a range of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer practices on irrigation demand, nitrogen uptake and carrot crop growth and yield. Results showed that soil moisture sensor-based irrigation reduced the amount of water used for carrot cultivation by approximately 30% over the calendar-based irrigation without statistically significant reductions in yield, and fertilization rates above 224 kg ha-1 showed no statistically significant increase in yield. A field-scale SWAT carrot model was calibrated using the field experiment data and validated using previously published experimental results. The carrot parameters were then incorporated into a watershed-scale SWAT model of the Santa Fe River Basin, a tributary of the Suwannee River, and used to assess groundwater recharge and nitrate leaching impacts of adding carrot into corn-peanut rotations across all row crop lands in the watershed. Modeling results showed that adding carrot cultivation to the rotation will increase irrigation by 32-43% and decrease net groundwater recharge from row crop land by 9-28%. Moreover, it will increase nitrate leaching from row crop land by 60-100%. These results indicate that adding carrot cultivation to the conventional corn-peanut rotation will make water quantity and quality standards in the region more difficult to achieve.",
