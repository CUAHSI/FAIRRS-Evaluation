  "abstract": "The VIC model is a large-scale, semi-distributed hydrologic model. As such, it shares several basic features with the other land surface models (LSMs) that are commonly coupled to global circulation models (GCMs):\nThe land surface is modelled as a grid of large (>1km), flat, uniform cells\nSub-grid heterogeneity (e.g. elevation, land cover) is handled via statistical distributions.\nInputs are time series of daily or sub-daily meteorological drivers (e.g. precipitation, air temperature, wind speed).\nLand-atmosphere fluxes, and the water and energy balances at the land surface, are simulated at a daily or sub-daily time step\nWater can only enter a grid cell via the atmosphere\nNon-channel flow between grid cells is ignored\nThe portions of surface and subsurface runoff that reach the local channel network within a grid cell are assumed to be >> the portions that cross grid cell boundaries into neighboring cells\nOnce water reaches the channel network, it is assumed to stay in the channel (it cannot flow back into the soil)\nThis last point has several consequences for VIC model implementation:\nGrid cells are simulated independently of each other\nEntire simulation is run for each grid cell separately, 1 grid cell at a time, rather than, for each time step, looping over all grid cells\nMeteorological input data for each grid cell (for the entire simulation period) are read from a file specific to that grid cell\nTime series of output variables for each grid cell (for the entire simulation period) are stored in files specific to that grid cell\nRouting of stream flow is performed separately from the land surface simulation, using a separate model (typically the routing model of Lohmann et al., 1996 and 1998)",
