  "abstract": "WRF-Hydro, an open-source community model, is used for a range of projects, including flash flood prediction, regional hydroclimate impacts assessment, seasonal forecasting of water resources, and land-atmosphere coupling studies. In this version, the Community WRF-Hydro code base has been merged with the NOAA National Water Model (NWM) code base to create a single, unified code base. On the ‘back end’ this means that there is now one unified code base supported by both the NCAR WRF-Hydro Team and the NOAA Office of Water Prediction. On the ‘front end’, the Community now has access to many of the features developed for the NWM, the first operational, high-resolution, hydrologic prediction model to be implemented across the continental United States. Some of these features include: additional methods for spatial transformation, enhancing the Noah-MP land surface model physics, and improving usability of model output files.\n\nThis is a singularity image file of WRF-Hydro that created from WRF-Hydro source code.",
