  "abstract": "The DOS based Stream Network Temperature (SNTEMP) model is a comprehensive physics-based model can be very difficult to run because it requires seven formatted input files that are very time consuming and difficult to create.   A general open source package SNTempInput was developed to create the required SNTEMP input files from a defined stream network, meteorological, and hydrological data  required to drive the SNTEMP simulations.  The software is intended to reduce the amount of time required to set up and run SNTEMP simulations to facilitate stream temperature related research and practice.   ",
