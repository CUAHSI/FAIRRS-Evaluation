  "abstract": "A multi-dimensional numerical model for sediment transport based on the two-phase\nflow formulation is developed. With closures of particle stresses and fluid-particle interaction,\nthe model is able to resolve processes in the concentrated region of sediment\ntransport and hence does not require conventional bedload/suspended load assumptions.\nThe numerical model is developed in three spatial dimensions. However, in this version,\nthe model is only validated for Reynolds-averaged two-dimensional vertical (2DV) formulation\n(with the k − epsilon closure for carrier flow turbulence) for sheet flow in steady and\noscillatory flows. This numerical model is developed via the open-source CFD library of\nsolvers, OpenFOAM and the new solver is called twoPhaseEulerSedFoam.",
