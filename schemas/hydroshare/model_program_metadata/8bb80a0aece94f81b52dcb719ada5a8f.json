However, it has additional components built specifically for SWAT model output for further analysis of model response. The file also has lot of useful information (tips) for hydrological modeling including basics such as 1) what to do for various conditions of hydrograph mismatch, 2) interpretation of model statistics, as well as the information regarding 3) where to look for the SWAT model parameters in SWAT. The program is easy to use with steps to be followed included in the main sheet  as well as a VIDEO TUTORIAL in the download folder.",
