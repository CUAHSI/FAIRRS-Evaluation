  "abstract": "Glimmer is an open source (GPL) three-dimensional thermomechanical ice sheet model, designed to be interfaced to a range of global climate models. It can also be run in stand-alone mode. Glimmer was developed as part of the NERC GENIE project (www.genie.ac.uk). It's development follows the theoretical basis found in Payne (1999) and Payne (2001). Glimmer's structure contains numerous software design strategies that make it maintainable, extensible, and well documented.",
