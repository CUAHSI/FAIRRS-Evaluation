  "abstract": "The EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a dynamic rainfall-runoff simulation model used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of subcatchment areas on which rain falls and runoff is generated. The routing portion of SWMM transports this runoff through a conveyance system of pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, pumps, and regulators. SWMM tracks the quantity and quality of runoff generated within each subcatchment, and the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period comprised of multiple time steps. SWMM was first developed back in 1971 and has undergone several major upgrades since then. The current edition, Version 5, is a complete re-write of the previous release. Running under Windows, EPA SWMM 5 provides an integrated environment for editing drainage area input data, running hydraulic and water quality simulations, and viewing the results in a variety of formats. These include color-coded drainage area maps, time series graphs and tables, profile plots, and statistical frequency analyses.",
