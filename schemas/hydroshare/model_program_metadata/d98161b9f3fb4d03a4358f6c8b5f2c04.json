  "abstract": "MHIA is a continuous hydrological model that computes a balance of the volume of water in the soil, taking into account the following processes: precipitation, infiltration, percolation, evapotranspiration and exfiltration. From these variables, the model evaluates surface and subsurface runoff, generating a hydrograph at the outlet of the modelled catchment. As input data, the model needs to be fed with time series of precipitation and temperature, with whatever time resolution. The model has 14 parameters that must be defined by the user or calibrated from observed discharge time series.",
