  "abstract": "Urban water demand modeling with regression identifies explanatory factors of water use in cities. A generalized demand modeling approach was developed for over 400 urban water supply agencies in California. Using standardized data from self-reported sources for agencies across the state, a batch-processing approach was used to create standardized urban water demand models. The models were developed to test the validity of a simplified and generalized demand modeling approach using monthly available data. Semilog, multivariate regression models were developed for each urban water supply agency. Consumption from residential (single- and multi-family), commercial, industrial, and institutional water use were considered as outcome variables. Explanatory variables include indicator variables for months in a calendar year, periods of water conservation requirements during a 2011-16 severe drought, population, and water rates. The models were of reasonable fit, with adjusted R-squared values ranging from 0.6-0.99. Visual inspection revealed that the monthly models captured trends with reasonable accuracy. The time frame for models was 2013-18, a period with standardized available data through statewide reporting. The modeling approach has been subsequently further extended to incorporate additional climate variables (precipitation and evapotranspiration) for sector-specific models. The models are intended to understand explanatory factors of demand through a generalized modeling approach and not intended to be used for water supply operations without further refinement and testing. The approach can be adapted to many types of cities.",
