  "abstract": "PIED Piper is a suite of Matlab functions and a standalone GUI compiled for the Windows operating system that allows plotting of Piper Plots. It is the first such code written in the Matlab programming language, one of the most commonly used coding languages for environmental scientists in academia and industry. The code and GUI allow plotting of data as points, or plotting data density with colormaps or contour plots. More information can be found in Russoniello and Lautz (2019), or the PIED Piper Manual.\n\nThe zip file contains MATLAB code, all files needed for installation of the GUI, the data input template, a manual describing the functionality of PIED Piper and several sample data sets.\n\nPlease cite as: (Russoniello and Lautz, 2019)\nRussoniello, CJ, LK Lautz. 2020.
