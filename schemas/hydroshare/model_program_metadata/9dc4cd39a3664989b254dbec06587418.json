  "abstract": "IceFlow simulates ice dynamics by solving equations for internal deformation and simplified basal sliding in glacial systems. It is designed for computational efficiency by using the shallow ice approximation for driving stress, which it solves alongside basal sliding using a semi-implicit direct solver. IceFlow is integrated with GRASS GIS to automatically generate input grids from a geospatial database.",
