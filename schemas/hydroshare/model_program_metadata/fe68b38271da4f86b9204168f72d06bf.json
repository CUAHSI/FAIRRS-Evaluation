  "abstract": "Nonlinear three dimensional simulations of miscible Hele-Shaw flows using DNS of incompressible Navier-Stokes and transport equations.\nThe code models the evolution of a diffusive interface and the instabilities that arises when a less viscous fluid pushes a more viscous one in a confined rectangular geometry. Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled to a convective-diffusive equation to describe the concentration field of the particles. In its current state, the code is restricted to low Reynolds number and Peclet number of order 1000.\n\n\nInput Parameters:\nGeometrical parameters: Nx, Ny, Nz, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, Z1, Z2 (ASCII);\nFlow parameters: Reynolds, Peclet, Viscosity Ratio; Flags: resume simulation, add wave perturbation.\n\nOutput Parameters (Binary):\nVelocities and concentration fields of the particles are stored to binary files at given time steps.",
