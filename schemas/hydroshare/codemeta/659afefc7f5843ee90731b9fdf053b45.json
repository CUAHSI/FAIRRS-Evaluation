    "description": "An HEC-HMS model of the watershed feeding USGS Station 01665500 \u201cRapidan River near Ruckersville, VA\u201d was calibrated using one set of storm data (May 04-10, 2017) and then used to predict runoff from three other storms. After the model was calibrated, it was used to predict basin outflow using three additional storm events (Oct 28 \u2013 Nov 02, 2012; May 24 -26, 2017; July 05-06, 2017). The results show that the calibrated storm matched well with a Nash-Sutcliffe of 0.96, but the other storms did not as Nash-Sutcliffe values did not go above 0.35.  . For storms 2, 3 and 4 it appears that the rain gage used did not capture the full precipitation that occurred at the basin. Rain gage data was taken Charlottesville Albermarle Airport located approximately 13 miles southwest of the streamflow gage. ",
