    "description": "This is the model data set for the Conduit Mass Transport Three-Dimensional Model (CMT3D) model of the Edwards Aquifer in the San Antonio, TX, USA region.  The model simulates nitrate transport through the aquifer matrix and karst conduits.  The results of this model are part of the manuscript \"Nitrate Transport in a Karst Aquifer: Numerical Model Development and Source Evaluation\" submitted for publication in Water Resources Research.
