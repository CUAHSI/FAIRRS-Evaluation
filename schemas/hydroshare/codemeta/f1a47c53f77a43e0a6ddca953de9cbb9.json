    "description": "This SUMMA Model instance is a part of the Clark et al., (2015b) study, and explored the impact of different stomatal resistance parameterizations on total evapotranspiration (ET) in the Reynolds Mountain East catchment in southwestern Idaho. This study applied three different stomatal resistance parameterizations: the simple soil resistance method, the Ball Berry method, and the Jarvis method.",
