    "description": "This is the model data set for the steady-state Conduit Flow Process v2 (CFPv2) model of the Edwards Aquifer in the San Antonio, TX, USA region.  The model simulates water flow through the aquifer matrix and karst conduits.  The results of this model are part of the manuscript \"Nitrate Transport in a Karst Aquifer: Numerical Model Development and Source Evaluation\" submitted for publication in Water Resources Research.
