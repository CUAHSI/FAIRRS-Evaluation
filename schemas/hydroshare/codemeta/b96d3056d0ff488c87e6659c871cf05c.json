    "description": "HFLUX input data used to run the diurnally fluctuating streamflow base case model discussed in Baker et al. (2018), \"The Importance of Incorporating Diurnally Fluctuating Stream Discharge in Energy Balance Models to Determine Groundwater Inflow Rates\".  The HFLUX model can be downloaded from http://hydrology.syr.edu/hflux/, where additional information on the model structure and inputs is located.  The 18 excel sheets include the model settings, time steps, distance steps, temperature boundary conditions in space and time, stream channel geometry, discharge data, groundwater temperatures averaged from 5 wells, weather data, average stream bed temperatures and the depth at which they were measured, sediment time, shade and cloud data, site latitude, longitude, and elevation, and the calibrated stream temperatures through space and time over a ~1.2 km reach over a ~5 day period.\n\nThis resource will be made public/published upon the acceptance of the corresponding manuscript.
