(2021), \"Toward Open and Reproducible Environmental Modeling by Integrating Online Data Repositories, Computational Environments, and Model Application Programming Interfaces\" to a composite resource containing them. The original MI, MP and modeling workflows were shared as composite resources in a collection resource by Choi (2020)\n\nThis resource includes:\n\n- 1 Model Program content aggregation\n- 7 Model Instance content aggregation\n- 2 uncategorized folders for modeling workflows",
