    "description": "This SUMMA Model instance is a part of the Clark et al., (2015b) study, and explored the Impact of the canopy wind parameter for the exponential wind profile on simulations of below canopy wind speed at the aspen site in the Reynolds Mountain East catchment. This study looked at the impact of the Canopy wind parameter[0.10, 0.28, 0.50, 0.750] as used in the parameterization described by the exponential wind profile",
