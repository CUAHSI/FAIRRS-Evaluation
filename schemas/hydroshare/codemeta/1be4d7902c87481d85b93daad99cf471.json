    "description": "It was created using HydroShare UEB model inputs preparation application which utilized the HydroDS modeling web services (https://github.com/CI-WATER/Hydro-DS). The model inputs data files include: watershed.nc, aspect.nc, slope.nc, cc.nc, hcan.nc, lai.nc, vp0.nc, tmin0.nc, tmax0.nc, srad0.nc, prcp0.nc, ueb_setup.py, hydrogate.py. The model parameter files include: control.dat, param.dat, inputcontrol.dat, outputcontrol.dat, siteinitial.dat. This model instance resource is complete for model simulation and the corresponding model output files are also included.",
