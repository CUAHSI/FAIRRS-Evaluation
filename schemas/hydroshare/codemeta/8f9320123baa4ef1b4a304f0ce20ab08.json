    "description": "This resource was created using the HydroShare UEB model input preparation web application (UEB web app) that utilizes the HydroDS modeling web services. The model input data files include: watershed.nc, aspect.nc, slope.nc, cc.nc, hcan.nc, lai.nc, vp0.nc, tmin0.nc, tmax0.nc, srad0.nc, prcp0.nc, ueb_setup.py, hydrogate.py. The model parameter files include: control.dat, param.dat, siteinitial.dat, inputcontrol.dat, outputcontrol.dat. This model instance resource is complete for model simulation. The corresponding model output is also included in the resource. Use a HydroShare user account and the link to access the UEB web app (https://appsdev.hydroshare.org/apps/ueb-app/) to run and reproduce this model instance.",
