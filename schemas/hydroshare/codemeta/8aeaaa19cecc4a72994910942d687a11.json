    "description": "SWAT model for the Boyne River, located in northern Michigan, USA. The model uses citizen science data from CrowdHydrology <http://www.crowdhydrology.com/>. The model was calibrated using the following stations: MI1023. MI124, MI1025, MI1026. The SWAT model was built using ArcSWAT Version 2012.10_4.19. \n\nWe acknowledge the Friends of the Boyne River <https://boyneriver.org/> and Michigan Trout Unlimited <http://www.michigantu.org/> for their role in community engagement, support during field visits, and maintenance of the CrowdHydrology network. The authors gratefully acknowledge the active participation of citizens near the Boyne River.",
