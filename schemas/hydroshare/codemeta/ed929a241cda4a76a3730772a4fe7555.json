    "description": "These files accompany the manuscript \"Restoring a Natural Fire Regime Alters the Water Balance of a Sierra Nevada Catchment\" submitted for publication with Water Resources Research. The input files are meant to be run with the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System  (RHESSys) model. The files included here were used to run models of the Upper Merced River watershed, as well as a sub-watershed (the Illilouette Creek Basin). The model output can be used to compare the hydrology of the Illilouette Creek Basin and Upper Merced Watershed under unburned conditions compared to a model watershed that includes vegetation cover changes induced by the actual fire history.  Instructions for installing RHESSys can be found here: https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys/wiki/Installing-RHESSys-and-associated-programs.",
