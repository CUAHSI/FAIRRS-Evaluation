  "abstract": "This resource models outflow at USGS station 01665500 using HEC-HMS software. Precipitation data was imported from the Charlottesville-Albemarle regional airport, which is located about 13 miles northeast of the outflow gage. SCS-curve number, SCS Unit Hydrograph, baseflow recession, and Muskingum routing methods were selected in HEC-HMS. No canopy or surface method was used. The model was calibrated using a precipitation event on 05/05/2016, and tested using an event from 4/19-20/2015. Results show an underestimation of peak outflow of 15% compared to observed data for one model test. The most significant discrepancy between the model and observed outflow is peak flow time, which is likely due in large part to the 13 mile distance between precipitation and outflow gages. Differences may also be due to varying antecedent moisture conditions. This project was an assignment for CE-6230 (Hydrology) at the University of Virginia.",
