  "abstract": "A permeable pavement green infrastructure (GI) site, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, was simulated using ParFlow.CLM. We utilized 1-m horizontal gridding, representing a site area of 400 square meters. Vertical discretization was variable ranging from 0.01 to 5m with the terrain-following grid feature of ParFlow.CLM activated. The model domain contains 8,000 finite difference cells. The simulation period was 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016. \nThe zip archive (.zip) contains the inputs required to execute the model run. These include: ParFlow binary files (.pfb) for the geologic unit indicator field and pressure initial condition, CLM text files (.dat and .txt) for input parameters, 1-D NLDAS2 forcing, vegetation matrix and vegetation parameters, and a ParFlow input tcl file to generate model input database (.tcl). CLM restart files (.rst) contain the CLM initial condition.  A Bash shell script (.sh) containing model dimensions is also included.",
