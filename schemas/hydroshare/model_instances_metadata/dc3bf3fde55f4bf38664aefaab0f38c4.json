  "abstract": "This is the model data set for the Conduit Flow Process version 2 (CFPv2) model of the Edwards Aquifer in the San Antonio, TX, USA region.  The model simulates water movement through the aquifer matrix and karst conduits for calendar years 2001-2010.  The results of this model are part of the manuscript \"Nitrate Transport in a Karst Aquifer: Numerical Model Development and Source Evaluation\" submitted for publication in Water Resources Research.
