  "abstract": "Modeling decenteralized technique to mitigate flooding in urbanized watersheds by using EPA-SWMM. The study area is Rocky Branch watershed, Columbia, SC. All the uploaded files for this instance are in full version except the input file. The input file just shows how the sub-catchments look like in the Rocky Branch watershed area.  The full version of the input file will be uploaded once the paper is accepted.",
