  "abstract": "EPA Storm Water Modeling Management (SWMM) for a subcatchment in Salt Lake Valley, Red Butte Creek. It considers both the mountain and the urbanized areas. \nThis model still needs to be calibrated based on different intensities and periods of rainfall.\nThe SCS curve number, which is a simple and efficient method for determining the amount of runoff from a rainfall event in a particular area, was used for infiltration analyses.\nthe boundaries of subcatchment were derived based on a GIS-Hydrology work.\nAlso, soil information was obtained from National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) for the area of study",
