  "abstract": "Six headwater catchments of the Gwynns Falls watershed, located in Baltimore County, Maryland, USA, were simulated using ParFlow.CLM. We utilized a 10-m horizontal gridding, with catchment areas ranging on the order of 0.2 to 2 sq. km. Vertical discretization was variable ranging from 0.1 to 8m with the terrain-following grid feature of ParFlow.CLM activated. Model domains contained 69,120 to 505,440 finite difference cells. The simulation period was 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015. \nEach compressed tar archive (.tar.gz) contains the inputs required to execute the model run. These include: ParFlow binary files (.pfb) for permeability, slope and geologic unit indicator field, CLM text files (.dat and .txt) for input paramaters, 1-D NLDAS2 forcing, vegetation matrix and vegetation parameters, and a ParFlow input tcl file to generate model input database (.tcl). A Bash shell script (.sh) containing model dimensions is also included.\n",
