  "abstract": "This is the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model dataset for the Cibolo and Dry Comal Creek basins in the San Antonio, TX region.  This SWAT model simulates streamflow and nitrate transport in two karstic watersheds for calendar  years 1996-2010.  The results of this model were published in Sullivan, T.P., Gao, Y., 2016. Assessment of nitrogen inputs and yields in the Cibolo and Dry Comal Creek watersheds using the SWAT model, Texas, USA 1996â€“2010. Environ Earth Sci, 75(9): 1-20. DOI:10.1007/s12665-016-5546-0.  The model output was also utilized in the manuscript, \"Nitrate Transport in a Karst Aquifer: Numerical Model Development and Source Evaluation\" submitted for publication with Water Resources Research.
