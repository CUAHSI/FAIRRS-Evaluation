  "abstract": "This SUMMA Model instance is a part of the Clark et al., (2015b) study, and explored the impact of the lateral flux of liquid water on Runoff using a SUMMA model for the Reynolds Mountain East catchment. This study looked at the sensitivity of the different model representation of the lateral flux of liquid water, which determines the availability of soil water.",
