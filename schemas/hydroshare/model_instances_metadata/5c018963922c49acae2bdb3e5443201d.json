  "abstract": "A three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model (MODFLOW-USG) was developed for the Wood River Valley (WRV) aquifer system, south-central Idaho, to evaluate groundwater and surface-water availability at the regional scale. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation Idaho Department of Water Resources, used the transient groundwater flow model to simulate historical hydraulic head conditions from 1995 to 2010. This USGS data release contains all of the input and output files for the simulation described in the associated model documentation report (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20165080).",
