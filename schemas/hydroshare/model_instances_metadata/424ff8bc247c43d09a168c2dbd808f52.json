  "abstract": "RHESSys model was adapted for US east coast urban catchments. This model was set at 30 m spatial resolution and using 3-D soil profiles extracted from USDA SSURGO. Local climate input data were collected by BES study group and combined with quantile-bias corrected MD airport climate records to extend its period coverage. There are some historical model results and ecosystem stage files simulating the shift in landuse from agriculture to residential land.",
