  "abstract": "This SUMMA Model instance is a part of the Clark et al., (2015b) study, and explored the Impact of the canopy shortwave radiation parameterizations on below canopy shortwave radiation using a SUMMA model for the Reynolds Mountain East catchment. This study looked at four different canopy shortwave radiation parameterizations: BeersLaw method(as implemented in VIC), NL_scatter method(Nijssen and Lettenmaier, JGR 1999:NL 1999), UEB_2stream method(Mahat and Tarboton, WRR 2011:MT 2012), CLM_2stream method(Dick 1983)",
