  "abstract": "This model was created for a graduate hydrology class assignment at the University of Virginia. The model was calibrated using streamflow and precipitation data from two different storms that took place in the Rapidan River watershed. The first storm took place on September 19, 2000, and the second storm took place on March 08, 1995. Streamflow data was retrieved from USGS NWIS, and precipitation data was retrieved from NOAA.",
