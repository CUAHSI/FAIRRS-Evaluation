  "abstract": "This HydroShare resource provides raw spatial input data for executing RHESSys workflows at 1- Coweeta Subbasin 18, North Carolina, 2- Scotts Level Branch, Maryland, and 3- Spout Run, Virginia. Assessing the conventional data distribution approach, these spatial datasets were manually collected and shared at the file level through small files.\n\nAdditoinally, the GeoServer and TDS approach will only use the observation data from this resource.",
