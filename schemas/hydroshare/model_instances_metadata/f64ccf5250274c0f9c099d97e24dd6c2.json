  "abstract": "The files provided here are input files for the river temperature modeling components created for the calibration exercise presented in Buahin et al. 2019, \"Parallel multi-objective calibration of a component-based river temperature model\" in Environmental Modeling and Software (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.02.012). Input files are organized into different folders for the different components as follows:\n\n1. Composition: Contains the coupled model composition files (i.e., *.hcp) used in the HydroCoupleComposer graphical user interface. It describes the components that have been coupled as well as the data exchange connections nodes between them.\n\n2. CalibrationComponent: Contains the input files for the calibration component specifying the calibration objectives, decision variables, and optimization algorithm to use for calibration.\n\n2. CSHComponent: Contains input files for the channel solute and heat transport component.\n\n3. HTSComponent: Contains input files for the hyporheic transient storage component.\n\n4. ObjectiveFunctionComponent: Contains input files used to specify the objectives to be minimized by the CalibrationComponent.\n\n5. RHEComponent: Contains input files used in the radiative heat exchange component.\n\n6. SWMMComponent: Contains input files used in the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) component.\n\n7. TimeSeriesProviderComponent: Contains input files used to prescribe time varying input data to other components.\n\nThe windows version of the HydroCoupleComposer executable needed to run this composition can be downloaded on Github (https://github.com/HydroCouple/HydroCoupleComposer/releases/download/v1.2.2/HydroCoupleComposer.msi)",
