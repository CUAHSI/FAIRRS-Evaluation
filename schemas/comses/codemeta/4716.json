    "description": "The model simulates the process of widespread diffusion (i.e., bandwagon) within an organization. Agents are subject to conformity and peer pressure as well as to a two-level organizational hierarchy. In the model, perceptions of the surrounding environment depend on individual cognitive attitudes (or `tolerance' to bandwagons), the level of ambiguity attached to social relationships, and organization size.",
