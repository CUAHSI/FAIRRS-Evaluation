    "description": "This model is pertinent to our JASSS publication \"Raising the Spectrum of Polarization: Generating Issue Alignment with a Weighted Balance Opinion Dynamics Model\". It shows how, based on the mechanisms of our Weighted Balance Theory (a development of Fritz Heider's Cognitive Balance Theory), agents can self-organize in a multi-dimensional opinion space and form an emergent ideological spectrum. The degree of issue alignment and polarization realized by the model depends mainly on the agent-specific 'equanimity parameter' epsilon. ",
