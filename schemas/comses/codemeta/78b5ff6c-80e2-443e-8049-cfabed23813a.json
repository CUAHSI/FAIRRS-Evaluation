    "description": "Organisms, Individuals and Organizations face the dilemma of exploration vs. exploitation\nIdentifying the optimal trade-off between the two is a challenge\nToo much exploration (e.g. gaining new knowledge) can be detrimental to day-to-day survival and too much exploitation (applying existing knowledge) could be detrimental to long term survival esp. if conditions change over time\n\nThe purpose of the model is to investigate how the amount of  resources acquired (wealth/success) is related to persistence with the strategy of local exploration under different resource distributions, availability of resources over time and cost of relocation",
