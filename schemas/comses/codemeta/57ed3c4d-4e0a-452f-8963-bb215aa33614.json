    "description": "The model is a microsimulation, where the agents don\u2019t Interact with each other. It simulates income distribution, unemployment dynamics, education, and Family grant in Brazil, focusing on the impact on social inequality. It tracks the indicators Gini index, Lorenz curve, and Palma ratio. The objective is to explore how these factors influence wealth distribution and social inequality over time.\nThis work was developed in partnership with the Graduate Program in Computational Modeling, in the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, in Brazil.",
