    "description": "The model is used to study the conditions under which agents will cooperate in one-shot two-player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games if they are able to withdraw from playing the game and can learn to recognize the trustworthiness of their opponents. When the agents display a number of symbols and they learn which symbols are important to estimate the trustworthiness of others, agents will evolve who cooperate in games.",
