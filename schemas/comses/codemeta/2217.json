    "description": "The purpose of Hegmon's Sharing model is to develop an understanding of the effect sharing strategies have on household survival. The model was developed with western Pueblo agriculturalists, specifically the Hopi, in mind. Households are modeled as sharing no resources, pooling all of their resources into specified groups, or practicing restricted sharing.",
