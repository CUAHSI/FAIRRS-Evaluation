    "description": "<p>The agent-based simulation of innovation diffusion is based on the idea of the Bass model (1969).</p>\n<p>The adoption of an agent is driven two parameters: its innovativess p and its prospensity to conform with others.\nThe model is designed for a computational experiment building up on the following four model variations:</p>\n(i) the agent population it fully connected and all agents share the same parameter values for p and q \n(ii) the agent population it fully connected and agents are heterogeneous, i.e. individual parameter values are drawn from a normal distribution \n(iii) the agents population is embeded in a social network and all agents share the same parameter values for p and q \n(iv) the agents population is embeded in a social network agents are heterogeneous, i.e. individual parameter values are drawn from a normal distribution ",
