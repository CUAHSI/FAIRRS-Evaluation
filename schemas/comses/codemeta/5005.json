    "description": "Under what circumstances management practices are locked in into a non-action situation thus favoring the spreading of pests and invasive species and what learning strategies may be more effective in avoiding such lock-in situations? \r\nHere we investigate a social-ecological model to assess the conditions that lead to successful management of ecological disturbances, varying disturbance effects (cost of treatment, effect of the disturbance on the social system, and the ability of the ecological system to recover from the disturbance when treated) and the type of learning employed by agents to combat such disturbances. We show how isolation and complete knowledge of neighboring management strategies, joint with a connected landscape affect adoption of management treatments able to counter the pest.",
