    "description": "The main function of this simulation model is to simulate the onset of individual panic in the context of a public health event, and in particular to simulate how an individual's panic develops and dies out in the context of a dual information contact network of online social media information and offline in-person perception information. In this model, eight different scenarios are set up by adjusting key parameters according to the difference in the amount and nature of information circulating in the dual information network, in order to observe how the agent's panic behavior will change under different information exposure situations.\n\n",
