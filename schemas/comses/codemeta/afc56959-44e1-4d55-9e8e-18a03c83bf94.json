    "releaseNotes": "The simulation model was programmed by using NetLogo5.0. A series of simulation experiments with different parameter  were carried out in this platform. Like many previous studies related to March\u2019s model, the default values were m=100 (Miller, 2006; Miller, 2010), n=100 (Miller, 2010; Kane, 2007), and y=50 (Miller, 2016). Each experiment run 200 periods and was iterated 100 times to avoid stochastic effects, and the averaging of the last-period data in 100 experiments was used as the basis for the analysis. ",
