    "description": "We coded the mathematical model given in the paper \"A Mathematical Model of The Beer Game\" using R (R 2013). The aim of this code is to ease the simulation replications of the model provided in the paper. This code is ready to be executed; one needs to simply copy the code from the file and paste it to R console in order to execute it. Note that the code for graphical output is also added to the original code.\r\n\r\nR CORE TEAM. (2013). R: A language and environment for statistical computing.
