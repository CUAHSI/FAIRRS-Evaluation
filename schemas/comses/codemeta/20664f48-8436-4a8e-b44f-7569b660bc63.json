    "description": "FoxNet is an individual-based modelling framework that can be customised to generate high-resolution red fox *Vulpes vulpes* population models for both northern and southern hemispheres.  FoxNet predicts red fox population dynamics, including responses to control and landscape productivity. Model landscapes (up to ~15,000 km^2 and bait layouts can be generated within FoxNet or imported as GIS layers. \n\nIf you use FoxNet, please cite:\n\n> Hradsky BA, Kelly L, Robley A, Wintle BA (in review). FoxNet: an individual-based modelling framework to support red fox management. *Journal of Applied Ecology*.",
