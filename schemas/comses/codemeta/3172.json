    "description": "Purpose\r\n\r\nStarting from the notion that agent behavior is fundamentally based on activity rules, it should be obvious that these need not necessarily be expressed in equations or in other numerical formats, but can also be derived from text information. Furthermore, one of the advantages of object oriented programming, as it is mostly used in agent based modeling, is that agents can have differing viewpoints and types of reasoning within the same institutional setting. In an extreme case, an agent based model should be able to handle different reasoning for every agent; although in practice it may be appropriate to group agents with an identical reasoning, however still different parameter values.\r\nThe purpose of this simulation is thus to demonstrate the feasibility of creating an agent based model of a political process based on the narratives of the participating stakeholders describing that process in qualitative interviews. The findings are complemented by transcripts of participating observations of group discussions of the same stakeholders. The simulation should not only be able to reconstruct past discussions, but also provide a tool to explore different institutional settings in which these discussions take place.\r\n\r\nAgent types and state variables\r\n\r\nThe model distinguishes between acting (\u2018agents\u2019) and static entities (\u2018resources\u2019). In this case, the agents represent the stakeholders, plus one \u201cRegional Management\u201d agent, while the projects (starting with projects funded in 2009, plus those generated by agents in later simulation scenarios) and the discussion arguments and development goals derived from the empirical analysis are inserted as resources. A \u201cWorld\u201d agent is responsible for global processes such as setting the date or saving output files.\r\n\r\n\n\n\nAgents (acting entities)\nState variables and types\n\n\n\n\nRegional Management\nProjects to be discussed and decided (List of Projects)\n\n\n\nDecided projects (List of projects)\n\n\n\nSchedule of meetings (List of dates)\n\n\n\nDiscussion log (List of speaking stakeholders and arguments brought forward)\n\n\n\nDecision log (List of projects decided with corresponding votes)\n\n\nRegional Stakeholders\nName\n\n\n\nAffiliation (municipality and sector)\n\n\n\nSchedule of events (List of dates and event types)\n\n\n\nIndividual development goals (List of development goals)\n\n\n\nAvailable discussion arguments (List of discussion arguments)\n\n\n\nProjects supported (List of projects)\n\n\n\nProjects dismissed (List of projects)\n\n\nWorld\nDate\n\n\n\nPath to output files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources (static entities)\nState variables and types\n\n\n\n\nProjects\nID-Number\n\n\n\nProject initiator (stakeholder)\n\n\n\nProject name\n\n\n\nDate of decision\n\n\n\nProject category\n\n\n\nFunding provided\n\n\nDiscussion arguments\nID-Number\n\n\n\nArgument category\n\n\n\nArgument caption\n\n\nDevelopment goals\nID-Number\n\n\n\nGoal category\n\n\n\nGoal caption\n\n\n\nProcess overview and scheduling\r\n\r\nThe simulation is organized in modules, each of which covers specific tasks of the simulation.\r\n\r\nModule 1) Project creation\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the agent \u201cregional management\u201d with one of the \u201cstakeholder\u201d agents is simulated at an average of every seven days to create projects that are added to the agenda of the following meeting of the (simulated) assembly. The attributes of the projects are negotiated among the agents corresponding to their development goals.\r\n\r\nModule 2) Invitation to the regional assembly\r\n\r\nUsually every second Wednesday of a month, the regional assembly congregates to deliberate about the latest project applications. One week ahead, the regional management agent sends invitations to the assembly members. This is implemented in the simulation by adding the meeting to the respective agents\u2019 schedules. The meeting itself is represented by saving a list of the agents met and the exchange of arguments when discussing the applications.\r\n\r\nModule 3) Discussions in the regional assembly\r\n\r\nThe agents pipe up and bring forward discussion arguments from a pool of available arguments as investigated empirically. The course of the discussion is logged by the regional management agent. Because a clear assignment of argument categories to groups of agents is not empirically supported, the starting point of discussions is chosen at random. However, depending on the category of the project in question, arguments are preselected in a way that is consistent with the meetings\u2019 observation results.\r\nIn case more than one argument category is available, the simulated discussions tend to remain in one of them at first, in which the single arguments may also be brought forward repeatedly. The longer the discussion runs, the more likely it will turn to a new argument category, but might as well return to a previous one. Furthermore, a few particular sequences of arguments are excluded to preserve consistency. The total length of a discussion is limited depending on the total number of arguments available.\r\n\r\nModule 4) Decision\r\n\r\nWhen the discussion has come to an end, the assembly members entitled to vote decide about each project application. A project is approved if the number of supporting votes is greater than that of dissenting votes. In this case, the application is removed from the list of pending projects and its budget subtracted from the total budget available. The agents decide predominantly according to the proportion of the own \u2018pro\u2019 and \u2018con\u2019 arguments in the discussion to support or dissent a project. Agent that had been silent during the discussion direct their vote according to the total numbers of \u2018pro\u2019 and \u2018con\u2019 arguments, thus being \u2018convinced\u2019 in the course of discussion.",
