    "description": "The code implements an agent-based model of intergroup attitudes in a community that is divided between two distinct social groups (which may be distinguished by religion, ethnicity, or some other socially distinguishing factor). The model is based on very simple premises that are both intuitive and justified by sociological research. The model shows interesting threshold behavior, and is amenable to mathematical analysis.",
