    "description": "A spatio-temporal Agent Based Modeling (ABM) framework is developed to probabilistically predict farmers\u2019 decisions in the context of climate-induced water scarcity under varying utility optimization functions. The proposed framework forecasts farmers\u2019 behavior assuming varying utility functions. The framework allows decision makers to forecast the behavior of farmers through a user-friendly platform with clear output visualization. The functionality of the proposed ABM is illustrated in an agriculturally dominated plain along the Eastern Mediterranean coastline. \n\nStudy area GIS data available upon request to gxh00@mail.aub.edu",
