    "description": "The objective of this study is to create a framework to simulate and analyze the effect of multiple business scenarios on the adoption behavior of a group of technology products. \r\nIn our modeling framework, the adoption behavior of a technology will be influenced by it's value proposition in comparison to the other available technologies. We present the use of an agent based model in which potential adopters of a technology are allowed to be influenced by their local interactions within the social network of bounded agents. Additionally, consumers evaluate the value proposition of the available technologies based on the technologies attributes, including technologies attractiveness.",
