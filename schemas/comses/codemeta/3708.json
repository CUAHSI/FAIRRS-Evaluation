    "description": "The Consumption Italy (CITA) model is an empirically grounded agent-based model designed to represent household consumption in Italy and to estimate the related greenhouse gas emissions under different environmental policy scenarios. We consider the domains of food, transportation and domestic energy consumption. We explored the effect of a price increase for goods and services with high environmental impact (e.g., because of the introduction carbon taxes) and of a change of agents\u2019 environmental concern (e.g., because of information campaigns). We found that both kind of actions can orient people consumption in the desired direction. However, their target and intensity should be carefully calibrated to produce significant effects at an acceptable cost.",
