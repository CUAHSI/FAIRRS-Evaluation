    "description": "This code simulates individual-level, longitudinal substance use patterns that can be used to understand how cross-sectional U-shaped distributions of population substance use emerge. Each independent computational object transitions between two states: using a substance (State 1), or not using a substance (State 2). The simulation has two core components. Component 1: each object is assigned a unique risk factor transition probability and unique protective factor transition probability. Component 2: each object\u2019s current decision to use or not use the substance is influenced by the object\u2019s history of decisions (i.e., \u201cpath dependence\u201d). ",
