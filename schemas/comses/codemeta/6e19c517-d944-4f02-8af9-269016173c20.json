    "description": "This study presents a System Dynamics (SD) model that explores the \"trajectories of homelessness\" among youth outside of the formal care system. Unlike traditional approaches that view runaway behavior as a discrete choice, this model reinterprets it as a neurobiological adaptation to chronic resource deprivation and systemic neglect.\n\u200bThe model incorporates key mechanisms such as 'Allostatic Load' accumulation, 'PFC-Amygdala Switching', and the 'Iatrogenic Effects' of shelter policies. It utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate how structural factors create a \"probabilistic vulnerability,\" trapping youth in cycles of survival crime and isolation regardless of individual resilience.\n\u200bThe uploaded code includes a Python implementation of the model to ensure reproducibility of the stochastic analysis presented in the paper.",
