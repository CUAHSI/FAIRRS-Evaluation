    "description": "We present an agent-based model that simulates the structural evolution in food supply chain. This model allows us to explore how to improve the food quality safety in China. We consider three types of agents, namely, producer, middleman and government in the food supply chain system. They correspond to farmer, wholesaler and food safety regulator in real world, respectively. We model two modes of supply chain management: spot market transaction and contract transaction.",
