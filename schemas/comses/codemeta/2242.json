    "description": "Merger and acquisition (M&A) activity has many strategic and operational objectives. One operational objective is to develop common and efficient information systems that maybe the source of creating significant cost savings for the acquired company. The problem in combining the IS divisions of the acquiring firm with that of the acquired firm is that there are many hurdles when the technical and social system are integrated. Exactly how this process will evolve and exactly what results can be expected is hard to determine. This agent-based model, after a careful scrutiny of the literature, implements all the critical factors for a successful M&A process and uses Simulation  to study how the forces from each organization interact over time.",
