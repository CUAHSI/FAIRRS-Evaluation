    "description": "The purpose of the simulation is to evaluate alternative interventions by a value chain development program, aiming to improve rural livelihood and food and nutrition security. In northern Ghana, where distrust between the partners can be a problem in the functioning of value chains, the program supports the incorporation of smallholder farmers in soy clusters or agriculture APEX organization (farmers' co-operatives) with a fair business environment. The goal is to to include the smallholder farmers in a strong value chain and reduce distrust.",
