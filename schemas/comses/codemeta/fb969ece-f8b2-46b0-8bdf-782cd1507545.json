The recommended method of using this code is to create a Repast Simphony project and re-create the subdirectory structure in the src folder, then manually copy the individual .java files into place.\n\nYou may need to create an 'out' and an 'output' directory for some of the results to be written correctly.\n\nRepast will create a 'lib' directory; when this model was run, the directory contained:\n\ngt-arcgrid-9.2.jar\nimageio-ext-arcgrid-1.1.7.\nimageio-ext-utilities-1.1.7.jar\nnetcdfAll-4.3.jar\nzmq.jar\n\nThese should be obtained from their respective publishers.",
