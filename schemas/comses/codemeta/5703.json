    "description": "THe model represents a village in the surroundings of Beijing, called Huangchao Fanbu Yaoliie. In this village runs an experiment about the recycling behaviour of its citizens. With collectors, containers and rewards the experiment tries to stimulate the civilians to recycle their valuable waste. The village consists of three separate areas, namely the university area (west and northwest), the area that is mostly populated by locals (east and northeast) and the area with independent housing (southwest, south and southeast). In the area the experiment placed six containers where civilians could get rid of the waste. The behaviour of the households is tested with three different social theories, namely the theory of reasoned action (TRA), the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the theory of planned behaviour extended with situational factors (TPB+).",
