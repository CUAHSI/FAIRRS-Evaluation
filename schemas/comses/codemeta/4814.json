    "description": "The underlying rationale of the agents in the STECCAR model is structured through the Consumat approach; a cognitive framework based on theories from psychology and economics. Within this approach, agents are defined by their individual needs, abilities, decision-making process, and personality. \r\n\r\nAt the shared car market, agents may purchase gasoline vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles. Each fuel technology comes with its own functional and financial characteristics. Mimicking the actual Dutch car market, three types of agents are defined using the input survey: lessees, purchasers of new vehicles and purchasers of second hand cars.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the results of 1.795 survey respondents were used to initialise each individual agent after a Dutch citizen with its own characteristics and driving behaviour. Because this survey data is currently still used in ongoing research, only a subset of the respondents -- 20 -- are represented in the attached simulation. To gain access to the full data set, please contact m.bockarjova@vu.nl.",
