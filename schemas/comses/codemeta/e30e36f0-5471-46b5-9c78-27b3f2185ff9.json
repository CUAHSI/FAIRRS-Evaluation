    "description": "Our model is hybrid agent-based and equation based model for human air-borne  infectious  diseases  measles.   It  follows  an  SEIR  (susceptible,  exposed,infected, and recovered) type compartmental model with the agents moving be-tween the four state relating to infectiousness.  However, the disease model canswitch back and forth between agent-based and equation based depending onthe  number  of  infected  agents.   Our  society  model  is  specific  using  the  datato  create  a  realistic  synthetic  population  for  a  county  in  Ireland.   The  modelincludes transportation with agents moving between their current location anddesired  destination  using  predetermined  destinations  or  destinations  selectedusing a gravity model.",

This will simulate a measles outbreak in the county Leitrim, Ireland. The model will run until no agents are exposed or infected. A behaviorspace is also setup to run the model 300 time and record important output variables.  ",
