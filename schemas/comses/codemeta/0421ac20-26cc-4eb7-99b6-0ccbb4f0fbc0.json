    "description": "The model aims to investigate the role of Microfinance Institutes (MFIs) in strengthening the coping capacity of slum-dwellers (residents) in case of frequent disasters. The main purpose of the model is system understanding. It aids in understanding the following research question: Are the microcredits provided by MFI to start a small business helpful in increasing coping capacity of a slum dweller for recovering from frequent and intense disasters?",

    "releaseNotes": "Setup sets up the selected settings of the parameters. Go initiates the simulation. A description of parameters is given in the info tab of the model. A user can focus on the changes on the coping capacity of residents as indicated by mean savings, Gini index and total residents owning their business. User can also explore what the effects are of changing frequency and intensity of disaster. How do they change when you include an MFI in the model and vary its settings such as repayment period?\n\n\n",
