    "description": "The AMMA simulates how news waves emerge in the mass media. It represents fundamental principles of public communication in a virtual media system: Drawing on the ideas of public arena models, the mass media are modelled as a public space, in which journalists report occurring events belonging to topics. Strategic issue sponsors initiate events for their favorite topics and compete for the attention of the mass media. The model helps to explore main drivers and mechanisms for the emergence of news waves and the resulting patterns of issue development. Four model scenarios are provided that each lead to different patterns of media attention. Scenario 2 produces the ideal-type of issue-attention cycle as proposed by Luhmann (1970) and Downs (1972).",
