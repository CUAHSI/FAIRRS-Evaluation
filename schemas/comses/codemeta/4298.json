    "description": "**IDEAL** is a land use change ABM in which developer agents make decisions on where to locate new residential land. The agent operate on a lattice of grid cells with up-to-three landscape characteristics: scenic beauty, accessibility, and land value. At each simulation step, all agents investigate available land parcels and make up a preference list, which depends upon land characteristics, their own demands, and their *attitude toward risk represented using gains and losses*. The agents evaluate available land parcels using the ideal point decision rule. Agents compare available lands against the best and worst cases in the landscape and, according to their own attitude toward risk, reassess\r\nland drivers and assign weights to the parcels. Conflicts are resolved by assigning that parcel to the agent who has highest preference order, and ties is resolved randomly.",
