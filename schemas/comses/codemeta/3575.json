    "description": "Peter Todd conducted a simulation for two-sided matching problem in symmetric setting in 1999. In his model there are the same number of agents in two parties, each of whom has his/her own mate value. Each agent in both parties tries to find his/her mate in the other party based on his/her candidate\u2019s mate value and his/her own aspiration level for the partner\u2019s mate values. Each agent learns his/her own mate value and adjusts his/her aspiration level through the trial period (adolescence). Todd tried a several search rules and the learning mechanisms. The rules and the mechanisms are symmetric for both parties in this setting. This NetLogo model is a replication of his model.\r\n\r\nPeter M. Todd and Geoffery F.
