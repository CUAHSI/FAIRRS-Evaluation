    "description": "LimnoSES is a coupled system dynamics, agent-based model to simulate social-ecological feedbacks in lake use and management. The focus lies on shallow lakes where ecological regime shifts can occur between the turbid and the clear water state. We provide a regime shift evaluation that includes social responses and regulation mechanisms of important drivers in the lake. In particular, the coordination among private house owners with insufficient sewage water systems and the regulating municipality play an important role since it causes time lags of social responses to changes in the lake state.",
