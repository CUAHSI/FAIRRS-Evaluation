    "description": "The model explores how corruption may spread endogenously within a closed society by depicting the behavior within a cellular automaton context (CA) between bureaucrats and citizens. Within the model, corruption is characterized as a behavior product dependent upon an individual's personal disposition towards honesty, rational decisionmaking processes, and neighbors' behavior.",
