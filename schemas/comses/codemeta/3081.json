    "description": "\r\nIn the context switching model, a society of agents embedded in multiple social relations, engages in a simple abstract game: the consensus game. Each agent has to choose towards one of two\r\npossible choices which are basically arbitrary. The objective of the game is to\r\nreach a global consensus, but the particular choice that gets collectively selected\r\nis irrelevant. \r\n\n\r\nThe agents switch contexts with a switching probability, in addition, agents avoid undesired \r\nneighbourhoods with a mechanism of segregation with a tunable tolerance threshold.  \r\n",
