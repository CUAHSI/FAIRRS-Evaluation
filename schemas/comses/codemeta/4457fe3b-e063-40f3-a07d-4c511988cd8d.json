    "description": "Model of the Corona pandemic outbreak \n\nThe COVID-19 ABM aims to predict the qualitative behaviour of the CoViD-19 epidemic dynamics for the greater region of Salzburg City. Specifically, by means of scenario testing, it aims to help assessing how containment interventions can allow a stepwise relaxation of the lockdown without risking a new outbreak. ",

    "releaseNotes": "## Overview \nThis is a bug-fix for the first release of the model \"COVID-19 ABM\" v 1.0.0. \n\n## Issues solved\n* the relative paths for two datasets (dem.tif and work_places.shp) were corrected. Now the simulation can be executed without errors \n\n## Steps to use \n* Download the model files in the given structure and save it on your computer\n* open GAMA v 1.8 (https://gama-platform.github.io/) and create a ```new``` -> ```GAMA project``` in the User Models\n* import ````external files from disk````, navigate to the downloaded model files and select the ```/code``` folder\n* open the CoronaABM.gaml and execute the \"simulate_ABM experiment\"\n\nAll necessary data are included in the file structure under the Corona/inclues folder and can be replaced by your own data.\n\nThe model is published under the open cc-by-nc-sa license. If you plan to use it for your region or develop it further, please drop me an email: gudrun.wallentin@sbg.ac.at.",
