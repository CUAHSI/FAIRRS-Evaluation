    "description": "What is it?\n\nThis model demonstrates a very simple bidding market where buyers try to acquire a desired item at the best price in a competitive environment\n\n \n\nHow it works\n\nThe idea would be to have a bidder market with the following characteristics:\n\n-       1 Seller or auctioneer who brings a good with identified characteristics: high and low pre-sale estimate\n\n-       Bidders with different propensity to pay for the artwork (value-assessment)\n\n \n\nEach Round (tick), the buyers decide to bid a higher amount or drop out. If the asked amount is below the bidder\u2019s value assessment, they\u2019ll bid. If it\u2019s higher, the decision depends on their desire-to-win, if it goes beyond their max bidding amount (value-assessment + desire-to-win), they drop out. Then each bidder individually decides to either raise or not their desire-to-win according to the position of the current asked price in their value assessment (chance of winning) and the remaining competition. For instance, if there are 8 bidders remaining (small competitive arousal), they are unlikely to up their desire-to-win. But if there are only 2 bidders left, they are more likely to enter a bidding war and up their desire-to-win.\n\n \n\nThe market will run through rounds until only one bidder remains. The sale value of the Item is the last bidded amount.",
