    "description": "The aim of our model is to investigate the team dynamics through two types of task allocation strategies, with a focus on the dynamic interplay between individual needs and group performance. To achieve this goal, we have formulated an agent-based model (ABM) to formalize Deci & Ryan\u2019s self-determination theory (SDT) and explore the social dynamics that govern the relationship between individual and group levels of team performance.
