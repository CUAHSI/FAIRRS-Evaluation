    "description": "The ABM model is designed to model the adaptability of farmers in DTIM. This model includes two groups of farmers and local government admins agents.  Farmers with different levels, with low WP of DTIM, are looking for economic benefits and reduced irrigation and production costs. Meanwhile, the government is looking for strategic goals to maintain water resources' sustainability. The local government admins employ incentives (subsidies in this study) to encourage farmers to DTIM. In addition, it is used as a tool for supervision and training farmers' performance. Farmers are currently harvesting water resources with irrigation systems and different levels of technology, and they intend to provide short-term benefits. Farmers adjust the existing approach based on their knowledge of the importance of DTIM and propensity to increase WP and cost-benefit evaluation. DTIM has an initial implementation fee.  Every farmer can increase WP by using government subsidies. If none of the farmers create optimal use of water resources, access to water resources will be threatened in the long term. This is considered a hypothetical cost for farmers who do not participate in DTIM. With DTIM, considering that local government admins\u2019 facilities cover an essential part of implementation costs, farmers may think of profiting from local government admins\u2019 facilities by selling that equipment, especially if the farmers in the following conditions may consider selling their developed irrigation equipment.  In this case, the technology of their irrigation system will return to the state before development.\n- When the threshold of farmers\u2019 propensity to DTIM is low (for example, in the conditions of scarcity of access to sufficient training about the new irrigation system or its role in reducing the cost and sustainability of water resources) \n- When the share of government subsidy is high, and as a result, the profit from the sale of equipment is attractive, especially in conditions of inflation. \n- Finally, farmers\u2019 honesty threshold should be reduced based on the positive experience of profit-seeking and deception among neighbors. \nIncreasing the share of government subsidies can encourage farmers to earn profits.  Therefore, the government can help increase farmers\u2019 profits by considering the assessment teams at different levels with DTIM training . local government admins evaluations monitor the behavior of farmers.  If farmers sell their improved irrigation system for profit, they may be deprived of some local government admins\u2019 services and the possibility of receiving subsidies again.  Assessments The local government admins can increase farmers' honesty. Next, the ABM model evaluates local government admins policies to achieve a suitable framework for water resources management in the Miandoab region.  ",
