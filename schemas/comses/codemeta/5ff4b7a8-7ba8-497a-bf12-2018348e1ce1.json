    "releaseNotes": "The model is designed to simulate farmers\u2019 behavior of transferring farmland in rural China. We create a world representing a village with heterogeneous farmers who can transfer in or out farmland. The farmers that transfer in land, in general large land holders, are exogenously chosen for the moment. The propensity a farmer transfers, in or out, farmland is determined by his age, degree of off-farm work.The amount of land that a farmer can transfers in is restricted by his optimal farming scale, whereas the amount of land that a farmer can transfers out is restricted by his survival farming scale. In addition, farmers are assumed to only transfer adjacent land in.",
