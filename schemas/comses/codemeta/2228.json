    "description": "This model was programmed for a class project, which studied the effects of urban sprawl on bird distribution.  For the urban sprawl part of the model, we started from the model in (udhira, H. S., 2004. Integration of agent-based and cellular automata models for simulating urban sprawl. Master thesis. International Institute for Geo-information Science and Earth Observation, Enschede, The Netherlands).  But in fact we did not exactly replicate Sudhira's model.",
