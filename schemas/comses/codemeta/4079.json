    "description": "The overall model had different builds that reflected specific situations (Table 1).  In one model build the signaler\u2019s effort did not result in a cumulative structure (as in dance displays), while in the second each signaler\u2019s cumulative effort could be observed by receivers (as in discrete nests).  Receivers also varied in disparate model builds; in a certain build, receivers could assess all the signaling individuals in a single time step, while in another build the receivers could only assess one \u201cterritory\u201d at a time.  Finally, in one model build signalers needed non-food display items for display, while in another build signalers could display after acquiring sufficient energy.",
