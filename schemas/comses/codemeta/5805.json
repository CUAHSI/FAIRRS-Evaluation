    "description": "The model, right now a beta model, includes four different fishing regions, stocks of different species unique to each sub-region represented by their logistic growth model. Fishers (clustered by fishing behavior, called fishing groups) can change fishing grounds based on meeting other fishers to compare revenues. With a certain probability that is linked to the difference in revenues, the fisher with the lower revenues will move to the sub-region of the fisher with the higher revenues.",
