    "description": "The Episim framework builds upon the established transportation simulation MATSim and is capable of tracking agents' movements within a network and thus computing infection chains. Several characteristics of the virus and the environment can be parametred, whilst the infection dynamics is computed based upon a compartment model. The spread of the virus can be mitigated by restricting the agents' activity in certain places. ",
