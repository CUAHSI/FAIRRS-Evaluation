    "description": "This model aims to understand the interaction between particulate matter and leaves of trees. The particles collide with the leaf and can either be absorbed with a certain probability, otherwise they bounce off it. The absorptions are detected in a counter.\nThe movement of the particles depends mainly on the strength and direction of the wind and the air temperature. They also show a certain random movement, but the proportion is negligible.\nIn a collision with the leaf, the particles are absorbed with a certain probability (absorption-probability), otherwise repelled.",
