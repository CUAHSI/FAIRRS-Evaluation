    "description": "CRESY-II simulates creativity as an emergent phenomenon resulting from creative production and evaluation processes exhibited by autonomous agents. The model demonstrates the effects, in terms of emerging product domains, of creators and evaluators. The former act on the basis of behavioural variability, i.e. a theoretical continuum describing how differently (variable) an individual behaves or creates from time to time. The latter act on the basis of varying levels of stringency regarding conventional evaluation criteria for creativity - novelty and appropriateness. An abstract model, CRESY-II was designed for theoretical exploration and hypotheses generation. It is the second model in a series designed to describe a systems approach to creativity in terms of variation, selection and retention subprocesses. The first is CRESY-I, and both were programmed with NetLogo 4.1.",
