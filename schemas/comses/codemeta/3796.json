    "description": "In this model \u2019satisficing\u2019 is implemented as a model for farmers\u2019 decision making in an agent-based farming model, that deals with groundwater over-exploitation in the \u2019Mancha Occidental Aquifer\u2019, Spain.\r\n\r\nOne aim of this work is to learn about the influence of alternative decision-making models on simulation results. Furthermore this work exemplifies a way, how a rather theoretical concept such as \u2019satisficing\u2019 can be transformed into a feasible decision-making model for agent-based farming models. Finally results of this model are compared to empirical data and to results of the base model, where a utility-based approach is used ([link to base model](http://www.openabm.org/model/2549/version/1/view)).",
