    "description": "The TERROIR computer model \u2014 **TERRoir level Organic matter Interactions and Recycling model** \u2014 was built to assess **soil fertility management** and the **nutrient recycling efficiency** of agro-sylvo-pastoral landscapes. It is a spatially-explicit ABM that represents the management of a typical West African **agro-sylvo-pastoral landscape** in space and over time. \nThe model focuses on the processes that create **biomass flows **and the related nutrient cycling. Here, it focuses on nitrogen (N) as a key limiting resource for both plant and animal production in West African agro-ecosystems.\nThe purpose of the model is to provide realistic estimations of the **structure of N flows** at different levels: land plot and herd, household and village. It is not intended to predict long term agro-ecosystem dynamics but rather to **compare** different agro-ecosystems, depending on input parameters concerning the structure of the landscape (proportion of land units, i.e. homogeneous part of the landscape in terms of land use and management practices) and crop-livestock systems diversity (linked to a typology of households).\nThe model can be further used to explore new improved agro-sylvo-pastoral landscapes.\nIt is coded with **[GAMA](https://gama-platform.github.io/)**, a multi-agent simulation and spatially explicit modeling platform.",
