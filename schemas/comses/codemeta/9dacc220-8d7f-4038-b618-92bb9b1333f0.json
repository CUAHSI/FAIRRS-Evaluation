Firms calculate production based on expected demand.\n\n2.  A decentralized labor market opens.\n\n3.  A decentralized credit market opens.\n\n4.  Firms produce.\n\n5.  Market for goods open.\n\n6.  Firms will pay loan and dividends.\n\n7.  Firms and banks will survive or die.\n\n8.  Replacing of bankrupt firms/banks.\n\nDesign concepts\n===============\n\n### Basic Principles\n\nNeo classical economy.\n\n### Emergence\n\nModel as a whole has the objective of generating adaptive behavior of the agents, without the imposition of an equation that governs the actions of the agents.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nFirms can adapt in each period $t$ price or amount to supply (only one of the two strategies). Adaptation of each strategy depends on the condition of the firm (level of excessive supply / demand in the previous period) and/or the market environment (the difference between the individual price and the market price in the previous period).\n\n### Objectives\n\nJust firms has the objetive of maximizing their net worth.\n\n### Learning\n\nFirms do not have learning, they present different responses to an environment that is constantly evolving.\n\n### Prediction\n\nFirms use both their own elements and the environment to make the prediction of the quantity to be produced or the price. As an internal element, it uses the excessive amount of supply / demand in the previous period; while the environment takes the differential of its price and the market.\n\n### Sensing\n\n-   Firms are able to perceive their produced quantity, their price and the market price, offered wages, profits, net value, their labor force and interest rate of randomly chosen banks.\n\n-   Workers/consumers perceive the size of firms visited in the previous period, prices published by the firms in actual period and wages offered by the firms.\n\n-   Banks are able to sense net value of potential borrower (firms) in order to calculate interest rate.\n\n### Interaction\n\nMacroeconomic results come from continuous adaptive dispersed interactions of autonomous, heterogeneous and rationally bounded agents that coincide in an uncertain environment.\n\n### Stochasticity\n\nElements that have random shocks are:\n\n-   Determination of wages (when vacancies are offered), `wages-shock-xi`.\n\n-   Determination of contractual interest rate offered by banks to\n    firms, `interest-shock-phi`.\n\n-   Strategy to set prices, `price-shock-eta`.\n\n-   Strategy to determine the quantity to produce, `production-shock-rho`.\n\n### Collectives\n\nIn addition to the sets of agents (consumers, producers and banks), groups of firms and consumers are selected as an emergent property of the simulation (rich and poor).\n\n### Observation\n\nAlong simulation are observed:\n\n-   Logarithm of real GDP.\n\n-   Unemployment rate.\n\n-   Annual inflation rate.\n\n\nAt end of simulation are computed:\n\n-   Distribution of the size of firms.\n\n\nDetails\n=======\n\nInitialization\n--------------\n\n<table class=\"tg\">\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-0pky\">Parameter</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-0pky\">Parameter</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-0pky\">Value</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">I</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Consumers</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">500</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">J</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Producers</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">100</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">K</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Banks</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">T</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Periods</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">1000</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">C<sub>P</sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Propensity to consume of poorest people</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">C<sub>R</sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Propensity to consume of richest people</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.5</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">h<sub>&xi</sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Maximum growth rate of wages</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.05</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">H<sub>&eta</sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Maximum growth rate of prices</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">H<sub>&rho</sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Maximum growth rate of quantities</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">H<sub>&phi</sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Maximum amount of banks\u2019 costs</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Z</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Number of trials in the goods market</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">M</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Number of trials in the labor market</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">4</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">H</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Number of trials in the credit market</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">2</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">w&#770</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Minimum wage (set by a mandatory law)</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">P<sub>t<sub></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Base price</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">1</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&delta</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Fixed fraction to share dividends</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.15</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">r&#772</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">Interest rate (set by the central monetary authority)</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">0.07</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nInput data\n----------\n\nNo input data were needed to represent process.\n\nSubmodels\n---------\n\n1.

Demand for credit is divisible, that is, if a single bank is not\n    able to satisfy the requested credit, it can request in the\n    remaining ![eqn-20](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H-1) randomly selected banks.\n\n21. Each firm has an inventory of unsold goods ![eqn-21-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S_&space;{it}), where excess\n    supply ![eqn-21-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S_&space;{it}>&space;0) or demand ![eqn-21-c](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S_&space;{it}&space;=&space;0) is reflected.\n\n22. Deviation of the individual price from the average market price\n    during the previous period is represented as:\n    \n    ![eqn-22](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_&space;{it-1}&space;-&space;P_&space;{t-1})\n\n23. If deviation is positive ![eqn-23](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_&space;{it-1}>&space;P_&space;{t-1}), firm recognizes\n    that its price is high compared to its competitors, and is induced\n    to decrease the price or quantity to prevent a migration massive in\n    favor of its rivals.\n\n24. Vice versa.\n\n25. In case of adjusting price to downside, this is bounded below\n    ![eqn-25-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_&space;{it}&space;^l) to not be less than your average costs\n    ![eqn-25-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$P_&space;{it}&space;^&space;l&space;=&space;\\frac&space;{W_&space;{it}&space;&plus;&space;\\sum\\limits_k&space;r_&space;{kit}&space;B_&space;{kit}}&space;{Y_&space;{it}}$$).\n\n26. Aggregate price ![eqn-26-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_t) is common knowledge (global variable), while\n    inventory ![eqn-26-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S_&space;{it}) and individual price ![eqn-26-c](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_&space;{it}) private\n    knowledge child (local variables).\n\n27. Only the price or quantity to be produced can be modified. In the\n    case of price, we have the following rule:\n    $$\\begin{aligned} P_{it}^s= \u200b \\begin{cases} \u200b \\text{max}[P_{it}^l, P_{it-1}(1+\\eta_{it})] & \\text{if $S_{it-1}=0$ and $P_{it-1}<P$ }\\\\ \u200b \\text{max}[P_{it}^l, P_{it-1}(1-\\eta_{it})] & \\text{if $S_{it-1}>0$ and $P_{it-1}\\geq \u200b P$} \u200b \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}$$\n    \n28. ![eqn-28-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\eta_&space;{it}) is a randomized term uniformly distributed in the\n    range ![eqn-28-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(0,&space;h_&space;\\eta)) and ![eqn-28-c](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_&space;{it}&space;^&space;l) is the minimum price at which firm\n    ![eqn-28-d](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i) can solve its minimal costs at time ![eqn-28-e](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t)\n    (previously defined).\n\n29. In the case of quantities, these are adjusted adaptively according\n    to the following rule:\n\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    D_{it}^e=\n    \u200b    \\begin{cases}\n    \u200b        Y_{it-1}(1+\\rho_{it}) & \\text{if $S_{it-1}=0$ and $P_{it-1}\\geq P$} \\\\\n    \u200b        Y_{it-1}(1-\\rho_{it}) & \\text{if $S_{it-1}>0$ and $P_{it-1}< P$}\n    \u200b    \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}$$\n\n30. ![eqn-30-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\rho_&space;{it}) is a random term uniform distributed and bounded\n    between ![eqn-30-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(0,&space;h_&space;\\rho)).\n\n31. Total income of households (workers/consumers) is the sum of the\n    payroll paid to the workers (each household represents a worker) in\n    ![eqn-31-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t) and the dividends distributed to the shareholders in ![eqn-31-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t-1).\n\n32. Wealth is defined as the sum of labor income plus the sum of all\n    savings ![eqn-32](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?SA) of the past.\n\n33. Marginal propensity to consume ![eqn-33-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c) is a decreasing function of the\n    worker\u2019s total wealth (higher the wealth lower the proportion spent\n    on consumption) defined as:\n\n    ![eqn-33-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$c_&space;{jt}&space;=&space;\\frac&space;{1}&space;{1&plus;&space;\\left&space;[\\text&space;{tanh}&space;\\left&space;(\\frac&space;{SA_&space;{jt}}&space;{SAt}&space;\\right)\\right]&space;^&space;\\beta}$$)\n\n34. ![eqn-34-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?SA_t) is the average savings. ![eqn-34-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?SA_&space;{jt}) is the real saving of\n    the ![eqn-34-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?j) -th consumer.\n\n35. The revenue ![eqn-35-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_&space;{it}) of a firm after the goods market closes is\n    equal to:\n\n    ![eqn-35-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$R_&space;{it}&space;=&space;P_&space;{it}&space;Y_&space;{it}$$)\n\n36. At the end of ![eqn-36-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t) period, each firm computes benefits\n    ![eqn-36-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\pi_&space;{it-1}).\n\n37. If the benefits are positive, the shareholders of firms receive\n    dividends:\n\n    ![eqn-37-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Div_&space;{it-1}&space;=&space;\\delta&space;\\pi_&space;{it-1}).\n\n38. Residual, after discounting dividends, is added to net value\n    inherited from previous period, ![eqn-38-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_{it-1}). Therefore, net worth of\n    a profitable firm in ![eqn-38-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t) is:\n\n    ![eqn-38-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_{it}&space;=&space;A_{it-1}&plus;\\pi_{it-1}&space;-Div_{it-1}&space;\\equiv&space;A_{it-1}&plus;&space;(1-\\delta)\\pi_{it-1}).\n\n39.

Firm that goes bankrupt is replaced with another one of smaller size\n    than the average of incumbent firms.\n\n41. Non-incumbent firms are those whose size is above and below 5%, is\n    used to calculate a more robust estimator of the average.\n\n42. Bank\u2019s capital\n\n    ![eqn-42-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_{kt}=E_{kt-1}&space;&plus;&space;\\sum&space;\\limits_&space;{i&space;\\in&space;\\Theta}&space;r_&space;{kit-1}&space;B_&space;{kit-1}&space;-BD_{kt-1}).\n\n43. ![eqn-43-a](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\Theta) is the bank\u2019s loan portfolio, ![eqn-43-b](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?BD_{kt-1}) represents\n    the portfolio of firms that go bankrupt.\n\n44.
