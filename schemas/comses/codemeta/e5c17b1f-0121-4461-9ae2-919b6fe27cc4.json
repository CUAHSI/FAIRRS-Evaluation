    "description": "This model computes the guaranteed viability kernel of a model describing the evolution of a population submitted to successive floods.\nThe population is described  by its wealth and its adaptation rate to floods, the control are information campaigns that have a cost but increase the adaptation rate and the expected successive floods belong to given set defined by the maximal high and the minimal time between two floods.
