    "description": "The agent-based model is based on empirical research carried out by Transparency International Kenya and Ghana Integrity Initiative. In this the main actors involved in Water Service Delivery (WSD) are modelled in terms of a principal and an agent playing different games that reflect different social dilemmas. The payoffs of the various games are defined based on the transparency, accountability, participation and social cost of the relationships between the principal and the agent. The decisions of the bounded-rational actors take into account the expected payoff as well as social comparisons. The strategies adopted by the actors constitute different management practices. The model can be used as a Decision Support Tool showing the best payoffs according to different management practices.",
