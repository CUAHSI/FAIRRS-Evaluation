This extended model is described in this publication:\n\ufeffBrughmans, T., 2019. Evaluating the potential of computational modelling for informing debates on Roman economic integration, in: Verboven, K., Poblome, J. (Eds.), Structural Determinants in the Roman World.\n\nOLD VERSION:\nThis agent-based model aims to represent and explore two descriptive models of the functioning of the Roman trade system that explain the observed strong differences in the wideness of distributions of Roman tableware.\n\nA detailed technical description of the model is published as:\nBrughmans, T., & Poblome, J. (in review). MERCURY: an agent-based model of tableware trade in the Roman East. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation.\n\nThe archaeological research context and interpretation of experiments' results are published as:\nBrughmans, T., & Poblome, J. (in press).
