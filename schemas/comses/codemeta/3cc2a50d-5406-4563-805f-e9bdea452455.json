    "description": "The model is designed to analyse the effects of mitigation measures on the European brown hare (*Lepus europaeus*), which is directly affected by ongoing land use change and has experienced widespread decline throughout Europe since the 1960s. As an input, we use two 4\u00d74 km large model landscapes, which were generated by a landscape generator based on real field sizes and crop proportions and differed in average field size and crop composition. The crops grown annually are evaluated in terms of forage suitability, breeding suitability and crop richness for the hare. Six mitigation scenarios are implemented, defined by a 10 % increase in: (1) mixed silphie, (2) miscanthus, (3) grass-clover ley, (4) alfalfa, (5) set-aside, and (6) general crop richness. The model shows that  that both landscape configuration and composition have a significant effect on hare population development, which responds particularly strongly to compositional changes. ",

    "releaseNotes": "The model requires two input files which define the two different agriculatural landscapes which the model is able to represent. The model was evaluated using BehaviorSpace, therefore it does not include any file output. \n\nThe GUI includes elements which are guiding the use of the program. ",
