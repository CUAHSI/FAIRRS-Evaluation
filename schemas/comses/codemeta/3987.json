    "description": "In the model, every farmer owns a farm and each has utility functions with bounded rationality. The farmers specialize in cash-crops such as corn, soybean or winter wheat. They have cash earnings from crop production or from enrollment in government programs. The farmers have different land areas, crop yields, and future crop price and yield expectations. The farmers also maintain network connections to other farmers and government agencies with varying strengths.",
