    "description": "***BorealFireSIM*** is a cellular automaton based model that serves to identify future fire patterns in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The model simulates yearly fire seasons and adjusts decadal climate variables based on two future carbon pathways (RCP45 (low emissions) and RCP85 (business as usual)). The ***BorealFireSIM*** model simulates future fire patterns up to the year 2100.",
