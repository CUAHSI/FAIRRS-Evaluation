    "description": "We model interpersonal dynamics and study behavior in the classroom in the hypothetical case of a single teacher who defines students\u2019 seating arrangements. The model incorporates the mechanisms of peer influence on study behavior, on attitude formation, and homophilous selection in order to depict the interrelated dynamics of networks, behavior, and attitudes. We compare various seating arrangement scenarios and observe how GPA distribution and level of prejudice changes over time. ",
