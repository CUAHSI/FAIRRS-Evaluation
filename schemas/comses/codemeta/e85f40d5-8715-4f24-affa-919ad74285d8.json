    "description": "A model of the emergence of intersectional life course inequalities through transitions in the workplace. It explores LGBTQ citizens\u2019 career outcomes and trajectories in relation to several mediating factors: (i) workplace discrimination; (ii) social capital; (iii) policy interventions (i.e., workplace equality, diversity, and inclusion policies); (iv) and LGBTQ employees\u2019 behaviours in response to discrimination (i.e., moving workplaces and/or different strategies for managing the visibility of their identity).",
