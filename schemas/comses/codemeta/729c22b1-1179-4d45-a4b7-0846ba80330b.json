    "description": "Car-centric societies face substantial challenges in moving towards sustainable\nmobility systems, with internal combustion engine vehicles remaining a major\nsource of emissions. Electric vehicles play a critical role in addressing this challenge, yet their diffusion depends on the interaction of consumer behaviour, firm\ninnovation, and policy incentives. This paper develops an agent-based model to\nexamine these dynamics, calibrated on the data for the state of California over\n2001-2023. In the model, heterogeneous car users influenced by their social peers\npurchase cars, both new and used, based on discrete choice theory, while manufacturers develop new car models, adjusting prices accordingly. We examine how\ndifferent policy combinations can achieve deployment targets while balancing economic costs, emissions and consumer utility. Our simulations compare individual\nand combined policy instruments, including carbon pricing, new and used car purchase rebates, production subsidies and electricity price subsidies. Results indicate\nthat only carbon pricing and new vehicle purchase rebates achieve a target of 95%\nelectric vehicle adoption by 2035. Each policy has key trade-offs: carbon pricing\nsubstantially reduces consumer welfare, while new purchase rebates create heavy\nfiscal burdens. Policy combinations prove to be more effective by reducing the\nintensity of the required interventions and minimising the induced rebound effect\nand trade-offs. Extended simulations till 2050 demonstrate that EV adoption rates\nstabilize after policy withdrawal. However, cumulative emissions in the business-as-usual scenario are lower than those of a policy-induced mobility transition until\nthe 2040s, indicating that additional policy is required to reduce reliance on private\nvehicles.\n",
