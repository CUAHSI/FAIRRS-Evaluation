    "description": "The diffusion of innovations can be affected by the interactions between individuals in a social group. Such peer effects can occur through different mechanisms. The basic mechanisms are classified as information effect (i.e., the transmission of information), experience effect (i.e., the sharing of experience), and externality effect (i.e., externalities). We model how these effects occur through different types of ties in social networks.",
