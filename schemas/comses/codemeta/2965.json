    "description": "Using nodes from the 2002 General Social Survey sample, the code establishes a network of ties with a given homophily bias, and simulates Internet adoption rates in that network under three conditions: (i) no network externalities, (ii) general network externalities, where an individual\u2019s reservation price is a function of the overall adoption rate in the network, (iii) specific network externalities, where reservation price is a function of the adoption rate in individual\u2019s personal network, with varying degrees of homophily.\r\n\r\nDetailed description is available in: \r\n\r\nPaul DiMaggio and Filiz Garip. 2011. \u201cHow Network Externalities Can Exacerbate Intergroup Inequality.\u201d American Journal of Sociology 116(6): 1887-1933.",
