    "description": "We present DIAL, a model of group dynamics and opinion dynamics. It features dialogues, in which agents put their reputation at stake. Intra-group radicalisation of opinions appears to be an emergent phenomenon. \r\nThis model may be positioned within the theoretical literature on opinion dynamics and social influence. \r\nMoreover, we investigate the  effect of argumentation on group structure by simulation experiments. \r\nRuns of the model can be compared with varying influence of the outcome of debates on the reputation of the agents.",
