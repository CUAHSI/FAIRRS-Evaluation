    "description": "Revolutionary movements have always served as focal points for social and political scientist\u2019s scrutiny, controversially, despite all efforts the field still seems impotent in prognosticating the impending collapse of regimes rather upraise of the corps. This paper argues that, the problem has ensued from flawed perception of systematic, endogenous and dynamic nature of social interactions, by using a \u201csystem dynamics  model,\u201d tends to both elucidate the internal interactions of the phenomena, and evoke the time series behavior of the key factors shaping the outcome. With the structured model in hand, we then proceed to analyze the policies executed and see how they failed their purpose in taking stranglehold over the insurgent movements.",
