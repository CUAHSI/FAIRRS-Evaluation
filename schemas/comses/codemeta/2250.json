    "description": "This is a first preliminary simulation model to model segregation in the city of Salzburg, Austria. Based on multivariate statistics (multiple regression analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis), the statistical districts are represented by cluster populations. These homogeneous populations are used for a sample of agents and patches (smallest discrete spatial units) in order to simulate segregation as a process of generating social and spatial similarity. Emphasis is on similarity since we assume no strong homogeneity but more mixed communities. The model is programmed with NetLogo 4.0.2 and the GIS 1.0 extension.",
