    "description": "This documentation provides an overview and explanation of the NetLogo simulation code for modeling skilled workers' migration in Iran. The simulation aims to explore the dynamics of skilled workers' migration and their transition through various states, including training, employment, and immigration.\n\nThe flow of elite and talent migration, or \"brain drain,\" is a complex issue with far-reaching implications for developing countries. The decision to migrate is made due to various factors including economic opportunities, political stability, social factors and personal circumstances.\nMeasuring individual interests in the field of immigration is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors. The agent-based model is a useful tool for understanding the complex factors that are involved in talent migration. By considering the various social, economic, and personal factors that influence migration decisions, policymakers can provide more effective strategies to retain skilled and talented labor and promote sustainable growth in developing countries. One of the main challenges in studying the flow of elite migration is the complexity of the decision-making process and a set of factors that lead to migration decisions. Agent-based modeling is a useful tool for understanding how individual decisions can lead to large-scale migration patterns.\n",
