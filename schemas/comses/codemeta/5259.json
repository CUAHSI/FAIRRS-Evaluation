    "description": "The purpose of the model was to simulate the spatio-temporal distribution of cyclists in the city of Salzburg during a weekday in late spring. The spatial distribution of the cycle trip density across the city\u2019s street network was expected to emerge from the behaviour of individual cyclists. The model was thus intended to be used as a base model to generate and test hypotheses on driving factors of cycle traffic and their implications for traffic management, route preferences, and effects of cycling infrastructure or the identification of accident-prone sites.",
