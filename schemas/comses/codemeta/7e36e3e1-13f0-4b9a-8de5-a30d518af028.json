    "description": "This model aims to replicate the evolution of opinions and behaviours on a communal plan over time. It also aims to foster community dialogue on simulation outcomes, promoting inclusivity and engagement. Individuals (referred to as agents), grouped based on Sinus Milieus (Groh-Samberg et al., 2023), face a binary choice: support or oppose the plan. Motivated by experiential, social, and value needs (Antosz et al., 2019), their decision is influenced by how well the plan aligns with these fundamental needs.",

    "releaseNotes": "This model is designed to replicate the dynamics governing the Evolution of Opinions and Behaviors on a Plan (EOBoP) among individuals, referred to as agents, within a community over time. Its primary goal is to investigate the evolution of opinions and behaviours and, secondarily, to foster dialogues among community members about the simulation outcomes, thereby promoting civic inclusivity and enhancing engagement.",
