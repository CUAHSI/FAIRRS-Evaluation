    "description": "This model aims to understand the cumulative effects on the population\u2019s vulnerability as represented by exposure to PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) by different age and educational groups in two Seoul districts, Gangnam and Gwanak. Using this model, readers can explore individual's daily commuting routine, and its health loss when the PM10 concentration of the current patch breaches the national limit of 100\u00b5g/m3.",
