    "description": "The \u201cDescriptive Norm and Fraud Dynamics\u201d model demonstrates how fraudulent behavior can either proliferate or be contained within non-hierarchical organizations, such as peer networks, through social influence taking the form of a descriptive norm. This model expands on the fraud triangle theory, which posits that an individual must concurrently possess a financial motive, perceive an opportunity, and hold a pro-fraud attitude to engage in fraudulent activities (red agent). In the absence of any of these elements, the individual will act honestly (green agent).\n\nThe model explores variations in a descriptive norm mechanism, ranging from local distorted knowledge to global perfect knowledge. In the case of local distorted knowledge, agents primarily rely on information from their first-degree colleagues. This knowledge is often distorted because agents are slow to update their empirical expectations, which are only partially revised after one-to-one interactions. On the other end of the spectrum, local perfect knowledge is achieved by incorporating a secondary source of information into the agents\u2019 decision-making process. Here, accurate information provided by an observer is used to update empirical expectations.\n\nThe model shows that the same variation of the descriptive norm mechanism could lead to varying aggregate fraud levels across different fraud categories. Two empirically measured norm sensitivity distributions associated with different fraud categories can be selected into the model to see the different aggregate outcomes.\n",

The associated manuscript for the conference proceedings is currently under review.\n\n## Related models\n\nThe \u201cDescriptive Norm and Fraud Dynamics\u201d model re-implements and extends the conceptual benchmark model variant of Davis and Pesch\u2019s \u201cFraud Dynamics and Controls\u201d model (2013).\n\nThe present extension implements a threshold model inspired by Granovetter (1978) and Bicchieri and Funcke (2018).\n\nVariation of the descriptive norm mechanism uses the parameter [beta] and the formula for calculating empirical expectations proposed by Bicchieri and Funcke (2018).\n\n## Getting started\n\n1.
