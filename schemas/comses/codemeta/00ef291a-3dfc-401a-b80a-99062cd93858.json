    "description": "An agent-based model for the emigration of highly-skilled labour.\n\nWe hypothesise that there are two main factors that impact the decision and ability to move abroad: desire to maximise individual utility and network effects. Accordingly, several factors play role in brain drain such as the overall economic and social differences between the home and host countries, people\u2019s ability and capacity to obtain good jobs and start a life abroad, the barriers of moving abroad, and people\u2019s social network who are already working abroad.",
