    "description": "This model contains three states. The main output of all three states is the change in the level of variability of specific traits over time. The first state simply looks at the effect of copying error during trait transmission over several generations. The second state integrates the possibility for agents to conform to the main trait pattern seen in previous generation, and the third state looks at agents' choice to copy a prestigious individual instead of their parents. Comparing the outcomes of all states shows that the level of variability in the transmitted decreases when conformism or prestige is added to copying error.",
