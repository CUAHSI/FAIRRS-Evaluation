    "description": "This model is to explore how individuals' cultural backgrounds may play a role in their Covid vaccination decision-making. Two cultural dimensions of collectivism/individualism and power distance are considered. Through the experimental scenarios, we find that Covid-vaccination opinions in collectivist societies can also be considerably polarised, if the power distance is less and authorities less centralised. This result complements the popular idea that cultural collectivism is usually associated with a high degree of social consensus. Hopefully, this study will help explain countries' difference in the response of Covid vaccination programs.",
