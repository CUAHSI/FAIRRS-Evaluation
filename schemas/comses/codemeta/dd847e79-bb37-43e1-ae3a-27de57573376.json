    "description": "This is a NetLogo version of Buhl *et al*.'s (2005) model of self-organised digging activity in ant colonies. It was built for a master's course on self-organisation and its intended use is still educational. The ants' behavior can easily be changed by toggling switches on the interface, or, for more advanced students, there is R code included allowing the model to be run and analysed through RNetLogo.",
