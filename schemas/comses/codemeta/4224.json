    "description": "This model is based on [Joshua Epstein\u2019s (2001) model](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013810410243) on development of thoughtless conformity in an artificial society of agents. Epstein\u2019s original model was based on spread of horizontal norms in a horizontal society of agents. Esptein\u2019s (2001) model showed \u201cthat individual thought \u2013 or computing \u2013 is often inversely related to the strength of a social norm. Once a norm is entrenched, we conform thoughtlessly\u201d. Instead of Epstein\u2019s original model, in this model, agents inhabit a torus world (which wraps horizontally and vertically in the shape of a donut). The dimensions of the world are 33 x 33. So, there are a total of 1089 agents in the world. This extension is insightful since it helps the researchers explore whether Epstein\u2019s assumptions about thoughtlessness are valid in other spatial arrangements or just an artifact of his particular spatial configuration. Updating Rules: The updating rules are identical to Epstein\u2019s original model. However, since it is a rectangular layout, agents look in all directions to make a decision.",
