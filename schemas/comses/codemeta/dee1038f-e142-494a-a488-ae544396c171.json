    "description": "The Relation-Based Model (RBM) purpose is to operationalise (a form of) process-relational (PR) thinking to serve as a thinking tool for process-relational thinking among social-ecological system (SES) researchers. The development of this model itself has been a 'Proof of concept'- exercise to see whether we actually represent process-relational thinking in a methodology that is entity-based (ABM). \n\nThe target of the agent-based model is to show the emergence, change and disappearance of fishing  assemblages (focusing on processes of self-organisation) in a Mexican fishery using a process-relational view.  From this view, a fishery is regarded as an assemblage in which fishing can be enabled, fishing can occur, and fish can be bought/sold. These core doings - or sub-assemblages or capacities - maintain the assemblage. Each (sub)assemblage reflects different actualisations of constellations of relations and elements (buyers, fishers, fuel, permits, vessels and wind). The RBM thereby reflects an artificial fishery in which agents (elements) and their links (relations) engage in (enabling) fishing and buying/selling.",
