    "description": "The agents represent suppliers try to implement their innovations via VCM and thereby have to target applicators. In this model, the supplier firm chooses between a cooperative VCM strategy, whereas the supplier and the manufacturer firm together present their innovation to the applicator and a non-cooperative VCM strategy, whereas the supplier firm tries to implement its innovation by its own. The success of the marketing attempt is measured in terms of the acceptance and implementation of the innovation as well as the marketing resources used. The basic model is extended with a representation of knowledge dynamics in and between firms. In particular, the supplier firm attempts to increase its marketing success by improving its knowledge base through adaptation to applicators\u2019 needs and individual learning.",
