This lead to unstable model behavior for certain ranges of parameter values. The current release includes a global variable called *meat-threshold* that sets the minimum value for large-game meat acquisitions as a function of hunter success and acquisition rates.\n\nThe new release also includes:\n- reviewed and updated ODD model description",
