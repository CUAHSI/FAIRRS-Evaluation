    "description": "The agent-based computational algorithm used by turtle agent is based on Wilensky [1] and gives to this the next improvements:\r\n(i) the algorithm has a variable number of searching directions in comparison with the Wilensky algorithm that has only four directions; thus the number of searching direction can vary from 4 to 360.\r\n(ii) the algorithm has two regimes: one is deterministic and uses the searching directions and the other is random and is used only if the first regime fails to find the resources that surrounds the agent.\r\n[1] Wilensky, U., NetLogo Wealth Distribution model. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WealthDistribution.
