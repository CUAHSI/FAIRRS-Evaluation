    "description": "This model presents an autonomous, two-lane driving environment with a single lane-closure that can be toggled. The four driving scenarios - two baseline cases (based on the real-world) and two experimental setups - are as follows:\n\n- <b>Baseline-1</b> is where cars are not informed of the lane closure.\n- <b>Baseline-2</b> is where a Red Zone is marked wherein cars are informed of the lane closure ahead.\n- <b>Strategy-1</b> is where cars use a co-operative driving strategy - FAS. <sup>[1]</sup>\n- <b>Strategy-2</b> is a variant of Strategy-1 and uses comfortable deceleration values instead of the vehicle's limit.\n\nTo simulate autonomous car-following behavior, we use the widely accepted Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) by Treiber (2000). In order to allow cars modeled with IDM to make lane changes in our two-lane freeway, we use a lane change model - Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes (MOBIL) - by Kesting et al. (2007).",
