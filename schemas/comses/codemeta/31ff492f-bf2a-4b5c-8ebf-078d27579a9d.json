    "description": "MI*Ov*CWD is a spatially-explicit, agent-based model designed to simulate the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Michigan\u2019s white-tailed deer populations. CWD is an emerging prion disease of North American cervids (white-tailed deer *Odocoileus virginianus*, mule deer *Odocoileus hemionus*, and elk *Cervus elaphus*) that is being actively managed by wildlife agencies in most states and provinces in North America, including Michigan. MI*Ov*CWD incorporates features like deer population structure, social organization and behavior that are particularly useful to simulate CWD dynamics in regional deer populations.",
