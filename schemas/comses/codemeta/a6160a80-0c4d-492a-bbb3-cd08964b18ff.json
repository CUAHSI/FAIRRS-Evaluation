    "description": "ReMoTe-S is an agent-based model of the residential mobility of Swiss tenants. Its goal is to foster a holistic understanding of the reciprocal influence between households and dwellings and thereby inform a sustainable management of the housing stock. The model is based on assumptions derived from empirical research conducted with three housing providers in Switzerland and can be used mainly for two purposes: (i) the exploration of* what if* scenarios that target a reduction of the housing footprint while accounting for households\u2019 preferences and needs; (ii) knowledge production in the field of residential mobility and more specifically on the role of *housing functions* as orchestrators of the relocation process.",
