    "description": "This model simulates economic and epidemiological interaction between citrus production and the disease Huanglongbing (HLB), which is vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid. The model is used to evaluate area-wide coordinated spraying when free-riding is possible given individuals' beliefs in other grower participation in area-wide spraying and in the information provided by extension on the threat as HLB spread.",
