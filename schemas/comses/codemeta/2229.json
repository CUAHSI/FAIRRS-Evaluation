    "description": "This model is a simulation of the ceremonial exchange network in Papua New Guinea called the Kula Ring.  In the Kula Ring, there are two types of gifts that travel in opposite directions: armshells counterclockwise and necklaces clockwise.  This model is a replication of some aspects of a model created by Rolf Ziegler.  The purpose of Ziegler's model was to account for the emergence and stability of this exchange network.",
