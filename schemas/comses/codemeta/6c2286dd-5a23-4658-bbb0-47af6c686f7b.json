This expands on v1.0.0 of the model by addressing a few major items from the \"EXTENDING THE MODEL\" section in the narrative documentation, like the ability for agents to change between walking types and the presence of intermediate travelling when the diagonals are enabled. While I do list one more way to extend the model further, your input on other ways to improve is much appreciated! ",
