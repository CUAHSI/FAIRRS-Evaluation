    "description": "This agent-based model uses agents that react based on economic and emotional levels and a revolution ensues. Once the revolution has begun, there are several other factors in this agent-based model that decide the outcome of the rebellion including agents being killed, their geographic vision, their inclination towards news/media, being influenced by current events, and also their personality type of A or B; all these factors combined together affect the dynamics of the unanticipated revolution.The model introduces more complexity and combination of attributes that can be used to study and forecast revolutions.",
