    "description": "Boyds (Boids that Fight) is an agent-based model in NetLogo that extends the classic Flocking model with multi-faction competition, a local fight\u2013flight heuristic, and a target locking/\u201ctaking\u201d mechanism. The model separates perception (vision) from engagement range (lock distance) and uses per-faction steering bounds to explore how local numerical superiority, sensing, and bounded turning affect victory, losses, and emergent formations.",

The model was originally written for the CAS-520: Agent-Based Modeling course at Arizona State University's School of Complex Adaptive systems, taught in Spring 2025 by Sean Bergin. The present release has only minor modifications for CoMSES compliance and user-friendliness.",
