    "description": "This base model uses an agent-based approach to represent heterogeneous farmers\u2019 trading partners selection among multiple recipients (other farmers, village collectives, and firms). Each period, a potential transfer-out farmer decides whether to transfer based on a net-return versus transaction-cost trade-off; if transferring, the farmer selects the counterparty with the highest expected profit. Meanwhile, social learning\u2014operationalized as logistic accumulation of neighborhood experience\u2014continuously updates uncertainty, which in turn shapes transaction costs and subsequent decisions.",
