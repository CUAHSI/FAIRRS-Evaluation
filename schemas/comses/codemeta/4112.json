    "description": "The model comprises four phases: initialisation, in which a network of agents is set up, with predefined 'creativity' and betweenness centrality is calculated. Simulation, in which agents generate new ideas, and ideas are evaluated for their value, in order to find interesting candidate coalitions. Subsequently, coalitions are formed in the negotiation phase. The evaluation phase calculates the dominant coalition and pays off 'power', or reputation, to the winning agents, to use as additional power in the next iteration.",
