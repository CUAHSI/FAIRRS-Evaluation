    "description": "This is an evolutionary computational model to investigating the effect of interaction parameters on trust and relationships formation with different levels of intensity, from very best friends to close and then casual friends. \r\nThe model starts with MainClass.java by setting population (total number of egos), the objectives\u2019 weights for resource, wellbeing, alliance, risk and stress. The model was generated by the defined objectives\u2019 weights as follows:\r\nSociaty sociaty = new Sociaty(genereatEgoes_random(population),rescouseWeight, wellBeingWeight, allianceWeight, riskWeight, stressWeight, per);\r\nWhere \u2018per\u2019 is the percentage of how many egos starting from strong tie preferred strategy in the interaction, defined as value between 0 and 1. This values will be changed in the evolving stage by mutation. \r\nSociaty.java is the class defining the interaction behaviour between egos. Parameters for the interaction behaviour are defined at the beginning of Sociaty.java. \r\nEgo.java is the class defining the interaction strategy and status of individual ego. Each ego keeps a list of ties and its interaction status with other ego.\r\nEach status of tis/interaction is defined in MeetLog.java.",
