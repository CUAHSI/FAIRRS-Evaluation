    "description": "ThomondSim is a simulation of the political and economic landscape of the medieval kingdom of Thomond, southwestern Ireland, between 1276 and 1318.\n\nIts goal is to analyze how deteriorating environmental and economic conditions caused by the Little Ice Age (LIA), the Great European Famine of 1315-1322, and wars between England and Scotland affected the outcomes of a local war involving Gaelic and English aristocratic lineages.\nThis ABM attempts to model both the effects of devastation on the human environment and the modus operandi of late-medieval war and diplomacy.\n\nThe model is the digital counterpart of the science discovery board game The Triumphs of Turlough. Its procedures closely correspond to the game\u2019s mechanics, to the point that ToT can be considered an interactive, analog version of this ABM.",
