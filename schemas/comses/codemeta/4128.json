    "description": "We assessed the impacts of climatic and economic variability on farmers\u2019 adaptive management of agricultural pests in the Ecuadorian Andes. We developed an agent-based model simulating an artificial society of farmers, relying on field data and validated models. Farmers were represented as heterogeneous autonomous agents interacting and influencing each other, and capable of learning and adapting to circumstances.",
