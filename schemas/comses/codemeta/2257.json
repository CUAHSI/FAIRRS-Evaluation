    "description": "This model is a market game for evaluating the effectiveness of the UK government\u2019s 2008-2010 policy on promoting smart metering in the UK retail electricity market. We break down the policy into four possible policy options. With the model, we study the impact of the four policy options on the dynamics of smart metering diffusion and suggest policy implications. The model is a practical application of agent-based simulation to the retail electricity market in the UK. The contributions of the model are both in the areas of policy making for the promotion of innovation diffusion in the electricity market and in methodological use of agent-based simulation for studying the impact of policies on the dynamics of innovation diffusion.",
