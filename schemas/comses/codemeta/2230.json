    "description": "This model demonstrates the spread of collapse through a network.  The model is abstract but has many applications in various fields.  One such application is based on the interpretation that each node represents a firm, and we are modeling the progress of collapse of a firm and its partners represented by link in this network.  Each node may be in one of three states:  stable, unstable, or collapsed.  This model was originally developed by one of the authors (AC) name below, and the model is called Institutional Bundle Theory.",
