    "description": "BarterNet is a platform for modeling early barter networks with the aim of learning how supply and demand for a good determine if traders will learn to use that good as a form of money. Traders use a good as money when they offer to trade for it even if they can't consume it, but believe that they can subsequently trade it for a good they can consume in the near future.",
