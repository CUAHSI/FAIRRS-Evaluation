    "releaseNotes": "The influence of personal norms on decision-making was revised in Version 1.1. The personal norm [0;2] is now transformed for the value range between [0;1] before it is multiplied in the decision-making function. For personal norm values \u2264 1, it is multiplied as: 1 / (2 \u2013 Personal Norm). That way, the transformed personal norm value in decision-making has the properties of ranging between [0.5;2] (i.e., halving or duplicating the intention for a behavioral action) and its neutral midpoint being 1 (i.e., not influencing the decision). \nThe norm internalization process was not revised in DINO model 1.1. The personal norm value may still be adapted linearly in norm internalization. ",
