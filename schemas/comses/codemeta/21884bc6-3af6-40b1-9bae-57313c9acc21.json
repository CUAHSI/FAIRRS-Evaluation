    "description": "This model represents an agent-based social simulation for citizenship competences. In this model people interact by solving different conflicts and a conflict is solved or not considering two possible escenarios: when individual citizenship competences are considered and when not. In both cases the TKI conflict resolution styles are considered. Each conflict has associated a competence and the information about the conflicts and their competences is retrieved from an ontology which was developed in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. To do so, a NetLogo extension was developed using the Java programming language and the JENA API (to make queries over the ontology).",
