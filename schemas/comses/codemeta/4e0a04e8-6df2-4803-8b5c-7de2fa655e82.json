    "description": "CapOvCWD is an agent-based model that simulates a captive cervid herd composed of adults and fawns. The model deer population is initialized using data on herd size and composition from captive facility records. Individual deer domiciliary history and annual CWD testing records inform the herd size and sample size (for CWD testing), respectively. The model can be used to iteratively estimate the facility level annual CWD detection probability. Detection probability estimates can be further refined by incorporating multiyear CWD testing data. This approach can be particularly useful for interpreting negative test results from a subset of the captive herd. Facility level detection probability estimates provide a comprehensive and standardized risk metric that reflects the likelihood of undetected CWD in the facility.",
