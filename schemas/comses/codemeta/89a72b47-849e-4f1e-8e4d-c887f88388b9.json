    "description": "The model aims at estimating household energy consumption and the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction based on the behavior of the individual household under different operationalizations of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). \nThe original model is developed as a tool to explore households decisions regarding solar panel investments and cumulative consequences of these individual choices (i.e. diffusion of PVs, regional emissions savings, monetary savings). We extend the model to explore a methodological question regarding an interpretation of qualitative concepts from social science theories, specifically Theory of Planned Behaviour in a formal code of quantitative agent-based models (ABMs). We develop 3 versions of the model: one TPB-based ABM designed by the authors and two alternatives inspired by the TPB-ABM of [Schwarz and Ernst (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162508000875) and the TPB-ABM of [Rai and Robinson (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215001231).  The model is implemented in NetLogo. ",
