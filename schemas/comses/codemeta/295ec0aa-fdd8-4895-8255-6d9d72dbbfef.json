    "description": "Social distancing is a strategy to mitigate the spread of contagious disease, but it bears negative impacts on people\u2019s social well-being, resulting in non-compliance. This paper uses an integrated behavioral simulation model, called HUMAT, to identify a sweet spot\nthat balances strictness of and obedience to social distancing rules.\n\nA novel agent-based model was developed that aims to explore social interaction while it is constrained by visitor limitations (due to Dutch COVID measures). Specifically, the model aims to capture the interaction between the need for social contact and the support for the visitors measure. The model was developed using the HUMAT integrated framework, which offered a psychological and sociological foundation for the behavior of the agents.\n\n",
