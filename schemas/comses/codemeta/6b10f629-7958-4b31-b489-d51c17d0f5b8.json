    "description": "B3GET simulates populations of virtual organisms evolving over generations, whose evolutionary outcomes reflect the selection pressures of their environment. The model simulates several factors considered important in biology, including life history trade-offs, investment in fighting ability and aggression, sperm competition, infanticide, and competition over access to food and mates. Downloaded materials include starting genotype and population files. Edit the these files and see what changes occur in the behavior of virtual populations!\n\nView the B3GET user manual [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wr4aChy_RD5ci6k5112fjuLEkFxOJs_Y04ZqzIqbFb8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n",
