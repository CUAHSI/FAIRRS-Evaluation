    "description": "This model WealthDistribRes can be used to study the distribution of wealth in function of using a combination of resources classified in two renewable and nonrenewable.\r\nThis agent-based computational model created in NetLogo 4.0.5 has the following fundamental characteristics:\r\n(i) the turtles are of two types: female and male;\r\n(ii) these turtles have a limited life expectancy determined by the parameters LifeExpectancyMax (maximum life expectancy) and LifeExpectancyMin (minimum life expectancy);\r\n(iii) patches stores a certain amount of water ResWater?0, a certain amount of food ResFood?0, a certain amount of coal ResCoal?0, a certain amount of oil ResOil?0, a certain amount of gas ResGas?0, a certain amount of uranium ResUranium?0, a certain amount of wind ResWind?0, a certain amount of sun ResSun?0, a certain amount of tides ResTides ?0, and a certain amount of geothermal heat ResGeothermalHeat?0; all these resources are converted in energy; these ten resources are divided in two: the first type are renewable resources and here are included water, food, wind, geothermal heat, tides and sun resources that are replenished on every simulation step; the second type are nonrenewable resources (coal, oil, gas, uranium);\r\n(iv) a male and female turtle can create a couple, and a number of children;\r\n(v) the children can inherit the wealth of their parents;\r\n(vi) the needs of every turtle are 1 of energy per one year processed from the available resources found on the patches;\r\n(vii) if these basic needs are not fulfilled then the respective turtle dies.",
