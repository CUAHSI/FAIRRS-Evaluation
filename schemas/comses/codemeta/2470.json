    "description": "Simulates the construction of scientific journal publications, including authors, references, contents and peer review. Also simulates collective learning on a fitness landscape.\r\n\r\nGenerates distributions, including power law distributions for papers per author and citations per paper, as seen in bibliometric data. Generates networks, including co-authorship and collaboration. Performs heuristic search on a Kauffman NK fitness landscape, effectively making the scientist authors a form of swarm optimisation.\r\n\r\nDescribed in the paper:\r\n\r\nWatts, Christopher & Nigel Gilbert (forthcoming) \"Does cumulative advantage affect collective learning in science? An agent-based simulation\", Scientometrics.",
