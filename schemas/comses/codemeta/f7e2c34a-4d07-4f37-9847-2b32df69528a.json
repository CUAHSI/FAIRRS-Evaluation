    "description": "The Rigor and Transparency Reporting Standard (RAT-RS) is a tool to improve the documentation of data use in Agent-Based Modelling. Following the development of reporting standards for models themselves, attention to empirical models has now reached a stage where these standards need to take equally effective account of data use (which until now has tended to be an afterthought to model description). It is particularly important that a standard should allow the reporting of the different uses to which data may be put (specification, calibration and validation), but also that it should be compatible with the integration of different kinds of data (for example statistical, qualitative, ethnographic and experimental) sometimes known as mixed methods research. \n\nFor the full details on the RAT-RS, please refer to the related publication \"RAT-RS: A Reporting Standard for Improving the Documentation of Data Use in Agent-Based Modelling\" (http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2022.2049511).\n\nHere we provide supplementary material for this article, consisting of a RAT-RS user guide and RAT-RS templates.",
