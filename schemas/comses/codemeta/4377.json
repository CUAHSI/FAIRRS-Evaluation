    "description": "The purpose of this simulation is to understand the emergence of technological innovation processes from the hypercycles perspective. We hope to reproduce the stylized facts of technological innovations in terms of the emergence of hypercycles through defining micro interrelationships between system functions. In this way, it is expected to find the most effective interventions that influence the emergence of hypercycles and thereby to assist decision-makings of technology policies.\r\nTo be specific, this general goal can be further divided into three sub-objectives: a) extending Padgett\u2019s hypercyce model to technological innovations and establishing a hypercycle model of technological innovations; b) testing the interaction patterns identified in previous qualitative study through using them as empirical input of the simulation model; and c) providing policy design support through if-then scenarios to experiment the effect of different interventions.",
