    "description": "Pandemic  (pip install pandemic)\n\nAn agent model in which commuting, compliance, testing and contagion parameters drive infection in a population of thousands of millions. Agents follow Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in the plane and collisions drive transmission. Results are stored at [SwarmPrediction.com](http://www.swarmprediction.com) for further analysis, and can be retrieved by anyone.\n\nThis is a very simple simulation that in a special case can be shown to be approximated by a compartmental model with time varying infection rate. \n",
