The time, effort, financial resources and conditions needed to successfully control dog populations and achieve rabies control can be determined by performing virtual experiments using DogPopDy. ",

    "releaseNotes": "We have developed a customizable agent-based model (DogPopDy) that can incorporate real-world processes like density-dependent survival, capture heterogeneity and immigration. The model simulation tool allows for relatively easy manipulation of all key parameter settings to test for capacity to effectively reduce populations within a reasonable period of time. ",
