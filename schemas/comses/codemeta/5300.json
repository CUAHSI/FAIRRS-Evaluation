    "description": "\u200bThe FN3D_V3 model has three main levels: person, household, and system.  Inter-related person- and household-level methods represent birth, death, and the creation/dissolution of male-female pair bonds (note: the terms \u201cpair bond\u201d and \u201cmarriage\u201d are used inter-changeably in this description and denote the same behavior in the model).  These methods and their inter-relationships were informed by data from ethnographic hunter-gatherers. \r\n\r\nMany parameters in the model are continuously variable, allowing the model to be used to \u201csweep\u201d through a range of values and observe how differences in parameters are related to model behavior.  The dependency ratio (the ratio of consumers to producers in a household) is a key variable in many economic decisions embedded in the methods.\r\n\r\nThis model is not intended to represent all details of any particular hunter-gatherer system.  The exclusion of extraneous detail is a purposeful strategy to aid in constructing a model whose structure and behavior are understandable.  The representations in the model are generic and broadly applicable to a variety of hunter-gatherer systems.  \r\n\r\nFN3D_V3 is an altered version of the FN3D_V2 model described by White (2014). \r\n\r\nFN3D_V3 was built using Repast Simphony. \r\n\r\nThe documentation provides (1) a description of the representations of time and the entities (persons, households, social links) in the model; (2) a brief overview of the major groups of methods in the model (pair bond, reproduction, and mortality); (3) model-level variables, parameters, and lists; and (4) a detailed description of the \u201crules\u201d and the operations of the model with specific numeric reference to sections of the code.",
