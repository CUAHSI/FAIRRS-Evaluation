    "description": "This code is for an agent-based model of collective problem solving in which agents with different behavior strategies, explore the NK landscape while they communicate with their peers agents. This model is based on  the famous work of Lazer, D., & Friedman, A. (2007), The network structure of exploration and exploitation.",

It runs the following functions:\n\tDefine-allele-values:\n\tSet-interdepenencies\n\tSpawn-turtle\n\tWire-ringlat\nRun_step: this function does the exploration and exploitation for each agent in each tick\n\tExploitation: fiDefinitionsrst it checks if any of the neighbor agents of any of them have a better solution. If so, it adops the better solution, otherwise it moves to to exploration\n\tExploration: depending on the type of the agent, the exploration behavior is defined.\n\n\tNote: run_step function uses to functions:\n\t\tExplore: this function randomly changes one of bites of the solution and returns a proposed new solution. It does not automatically update the agent\u2019 current solution. \n\t\tEvaluate: this function calculates the score associated to each solution\n\nThe rest of the functions are used to define the space and in the functions inside the setup function\n",
