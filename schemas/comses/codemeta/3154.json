    "description": "Authors: Lucia Tamburino and Giangiacomo Bravo\r\n\r\nMasting (or mast seeding) can be defined as the synchronous production of large amounts of\r\nseeds at long intervals of time by a plant population (Janzen 1976) and it is observed in several\r\ngenera. According to predator satiation hypothesis, plants would have evolved this synchroniza-\r\ntion ability to keep in check seed predators: large crops satiate seed predators that consequently\r\ndestroy only a lower proportion of seeds (Silvertown 1980).\r\n\r\nWe developed a model reproducing the interactions between trees, seeds and seed predators\r\nsimulating two forests: a realistic forest, where the masting phenomenon occurs, and an imaginary\r\ncontrol one, without it.  Such a comparison, that would have been impossible in the field,allows\r\na check of the validity of the predator satiation mechanism and, more generally, a comprehensive\r\nexploration of the effects of masting on both tree and seed predator populations.\r\n\r\nA full description of the model following the ODD protocol is enclosed.",
