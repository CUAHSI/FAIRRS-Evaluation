    "description": "This model looks at the effects of a \"control\" on agent populations.  Much like farmers spraying pesticides/herbicides to manage pest populations, the user sets a control management regiment to be used in the patch environment.  Agents also evolve an optimum dispersal rate for a given combination of controls.\r\n\r\nThe model is a modification of one described in The American Naturalist by Poethke et al. (2003).  There the author investigates the emergence of optimum dispersal rates for density-dependent and independent local extinction events.",
