    "description": "The author establishes a rudimentary metric called \"Permissive Score\" to measure the selectiveness of simulated government immigration policies. ABMs are then used to explore the impact of a policy\u2019s Permissive Score on the identification of human trafficking victims. Preliminary findings suggest a relatively high negative correlation (-0.77) between the permissiveness of an immigration policy and the rate at which victims were identified by governments with those policies.",
