    "description": "Unpopular social norms are shared behavioral rules which run against the  preferences of its subjects, or at least a large number of its subjects.  Bicchieri suggested in her 2009 book an explanation of the phenomenon  based on pluralistic ignorance, also offering a first tentative model of  the process. The model provided here adds substantively to the details and  explanatory power of a pluralistic ignorance-based approach to  unpopular norms.\r\nIt does so by endogenizing the agents' limited access to behavioral  information by situating them on a network, where they follow a simple  heuristic of conformism to choose their behavior, thereby contributing to  the implied shared belief in a norm.\r\nThe model reproduces not only the appropriate distribution of behavioral  expectations from a uniform distribution of preferences,  but also exhibits dynamic features of unpopular norms and pluralistic  ignorance that have been observed, in particular the lagging of the  distribution of behavioral expectations behind a changing profile of  preferences in the population.\r\nBeyond that, the model can be easily extended to include, for example,  central influences on behavioral expectation, as they are represented for  example by mass media or government propaganda.",
