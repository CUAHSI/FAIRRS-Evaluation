    "description": "This model is based on theories of emotional cognition from cognitive science,\r\ntheories of attitudes and persuasion from social psychology, and theories of social networks from sociology. Agents' beliefs and emotions about attitude objects are modeled as a parallel constraint satisfaction networks. In two case studies we showed, how the model can be used to address theoretical and practical research questions in the context of innovation diffusion and environmental psychology.",
