    "description": "Directs flow by the multiple flow direction method. Each node is assigned multiple flow directions, toward all of the N neighboring nodes that are lower than it. If none of the neighboring nodes are lower, the location is identified as a pit. Flow proportions can be calculated as proportional to slope or proportional to the square root of slope, which is the solution to a steady kinematic wave.",
