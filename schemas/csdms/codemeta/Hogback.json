    "description": "This model evolves a hogback through time. A resistant layer of\nrock, which weathers slowly, overlies a softer layer of rock that weathers\nquickly. Resistant rock produces \"blocks\" which land on the adjoining\nhillslope. Boundaries incise at a specified rate. User can set hogback\nlayer thickness, block size, and dip, as well as relative weathering and\nincision rates. Trackable metrics included are time and space-averaged\nslope, block height, weathering rate, and erosion rate. Parameters that users need to specify are surrounded by many \ncomment signs.",
