    "description": "Hillslope sediment flux uses a Taylor Series expansion of the Andrews-Bucknam formulation of nonlinear hillslope flux derived following following Ganti et al., 2012 with a depth dependent component inspired Johnstone and Hilley (2014). The flux :math:`q_s` is given as:\nq_s = DSH^* ( 1 + (S/S_c)^2 + (S/Sc_)^4 + .. + (S/S_c)^2(n-1) ) (1.0 - exp( H / H^*)\n\nwhere :math:`D` is is the diffusivity, :math:`S` is the slope, :math:`S_c` is the critical slope, :math:`n` is the number of terms, :math:`H` is the soil depth on links, and :math:`H^*` is the soil transport decay depth. The default behavior uses two terms to produce a slope dependence as described by Equation 6 of Ganti et al., (2012).This component will ignore soil thickness located at non-core nodes.",
