    "description": "This is a tool that I created to help find knickpoints based on the curvature of a landscape. It provides information about a stream including, knickpoint locations, Elevation/distance that can be used to create longitudinal profiles, XYvalues of all the cells in a stream path, etc. The tool uses built-in tools for ArcGIS 10.x (so you must run this on a machine with ArcGIS 10.x installed), but it is written in python. I used it with a 1m LiDAR DEM, so I'm not totally sure how well it will pick out knickpoints on coarser gridded DEMs.",
