    "description": "The Instructed Glacier Model (IGM) simulates the ice dynamics, surface mass balance, and its coupling through mass conservation to predict the evolution of glaciers and icefields. The specificity of IGM is that it models the ice flow by a neural network, which is trained with ice flow physical models. Doing so permits to speed-up and facilitate considerably the implementation of the forward model and the inverse model required to assimilate data.",
