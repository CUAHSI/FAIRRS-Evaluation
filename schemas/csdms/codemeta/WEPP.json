    "description": "The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is a process-based, distributed parameter, continuous simulation erosion prediction model for application to hillslope profiles and small watersheds. Interfaces to WEPP allow its application as a stand-alone Windows program, a GIS-system (ArcView, ArcGIS) extension, or in web-based links. WEPP has been developed since 1985 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for use on croplands, forestlands, rangelands, and other land use types.",
