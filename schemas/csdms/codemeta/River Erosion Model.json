    "description": "REM mechanistically simulates channel bed aggradation/degradation and channel widening in river networks. It has successfully been applied to alluvial river systems to simulate channel change over annual and decadal time scales. REM is also capable of running Monte Carlo simulations (in parallel to reduce computational time) to quantify uncertainty in model predictions.",
