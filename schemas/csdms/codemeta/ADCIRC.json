    "description": "ADCIRC is a system of computer programs for solving time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions. These programs utilize the finite element method in space allowing the use of highly flexible, unstructured grids. Typical ADCIRC applications have included:\n# modeling tides and wind driven circulation,\n# analysis of hurricane storm surge and flooding,\n# dredging feasibility and material disposal studies,\n# larval transport studies,\n# near shore marine operations.",
