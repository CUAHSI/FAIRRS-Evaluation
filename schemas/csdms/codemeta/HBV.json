    "description": "The HBV model (Bergstr\u00f6m, 1976, 1992), also known as Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning, is a rainfall-runoff model, which includes conceptual numerical descriptions of hydrological processes at the catchment scale. There are many versions created over the years in various coding languages. This description points to the work of John Craven, which is a python implementation of the HBV Hydrological Model, based on matlab code of the work of Professor Amir AghaKouchak at the University of California Irvine.",
