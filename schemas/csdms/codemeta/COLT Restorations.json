    "description": "A transect spanning three coastal ecosystems (bay-salt marsh-forest) evolves in yearly timesteps to show the evolution of the system. Geomorphic and carbon cycling processes allow for the exchange of material between the adjacent ecosystems. Each landscape unit is on the order of kilometers. Salt marsh restorations including sediment nourishment and shoreline stabilization can be turned on or off and modify geomorphic and carbon processes. Main geomorphic processes are featured in Kirwan et al. (2016) in Geophysical Research Letters, and carbon processes that track allochthonous and autochthonous carbon with time and depth are featured in Valentine et al. (2023) in Nature Communications.",
