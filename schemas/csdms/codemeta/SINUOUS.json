    "description": "Extended description for SINUOUS - Meander Evolution Model.  The basic model simulates planform evolution of a meandering river starting from X,Y coordinates of centerline nodes, with specification of cross-sectional and flow parameters.  If the model is intended to simulate evolution of an existing river, the success of the model can be evaluated by the included area between the simulated and the river centerline. In addition, topographic evolution of the surrounding floodplain can be simulated as a function of existing elevation, distance from the nearest channel, and time since the channel migrated through that location.  Profile evolution of the channel can also be modeled by backwater flow routing and bed sediment transport relationships.",
