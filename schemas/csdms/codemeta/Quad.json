    "description": "We present a geometric model able to track the geomorphic boundaries that delimit the fluvial plain of fluvial-deltas: the shoreline and the alluvial-bedrock transition. By assuming a fluvial profile with a quadratic form, which satisfies the overall mass balance and the boundary conditions dictated by diffusive transport, we are able to provide a solution that accounts for general base-level changes.",
