    "description": "pyDeltaRCM is the Python version of DeltaRCM (https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:DeltaRCM) by Man Liang (also available from the CSDMS model repository). This version is a WMT component but can also be run as a stand-alone model (see README.md).\nDeltaRCM is a parcel-based cellular flux routing and sediment transport model for the formation of river deltas, which belongs to the broad category of rule-based exploratory models. It has the ability to resolve emergent channel behaviors including channel bifurcation, avulsion and migration. Sediment transport distinguishes two types of sediment: sand and mud, which have different transport and deposition/erosion rules. Stratigraphy is recorded as the sand fraction in layers.\nBest usage of DeltaRCM is the investigation of autogenic processes in response to external forcings.",
