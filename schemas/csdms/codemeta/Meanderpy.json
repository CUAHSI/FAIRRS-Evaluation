    "description": "\"meanderpy\" is a Python module that implements a simple numerical model of meandering, the one described by Howard & Knutson in their 1984 paper \"Sufficient Conditions for River Meandering: A Simulation Approach\" (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR020i011p01659). This is a kinematic model that is based on computing migration rate as the weighted sum of upstream curvatures; flow velocity does not enter the equation. Curvature is transformed into a 'nominal migration rate' through multiplication with a migration rate (or erodibility) constant; in the Howard & Knutson (1984) paper this is a nonlinear relationship based on field observations that suggested a complex link between curvature and migration rate. In the 'meanderpy' module we use a simple linear relationship between the nominal migration rate and curvature, as recent work using time-lapse satellite imagery suggests that high curvatures result in high migration rates (Sylvester et al., 2019).",
