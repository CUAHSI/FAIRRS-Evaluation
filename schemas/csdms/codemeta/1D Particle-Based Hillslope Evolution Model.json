    "description": "This module implements a particle-based model of hillslope evolution, which has an associated continuum description (introduced here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02810). The model takes as input a few simple parameters which determine the equilibrium hillslope shape and dynamics, and can be used to produce equilibrium profiles and study the response of the hillslope to perturbations. The model benefits from straightforward implementation, as well as the flexibility to incorporate sophisticated perturbations and to be accessorized by local or nonlocal fluxes.",
