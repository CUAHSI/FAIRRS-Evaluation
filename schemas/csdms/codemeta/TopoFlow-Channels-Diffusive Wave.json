    "description": "This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model. It uses the \"diffusive wave\" method to compute flow velocities for all of the channels in a D8-based river network. This method includes a pressure gradient term that is induced by a water-depth gradient in the downstream direction. This means that instead of using bed slope in Manning's equation or the law of the wall, the water-surface slope is used.",
