    "description": "Icepack is a Python package for simulating the flow of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as for solving glaciological data assimilation problems. The main goal for icepack is to produce a tool that researchers and students can learn to use quickly and easily, whether or not they are experts in high-performance computing. Icepack is built on the finite element modeling library firedrake, which implements the domain-specific language UFL for the specification of PDEs.",
