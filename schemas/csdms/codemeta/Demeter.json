    "description": "Demeter is an open source Python package that was built to disaggregate projections of future land allocations generated by an integrated assessment model (IAM). Projected land allocation from IAMs is traditionally transferred to Earth System Models (ESMs) in a variety of gridded formats and spatial resolutions as inputs for simulating biophysical and biogeochemical fluxes. Existing tools for performing this translation generally require a number of manual steps which introduces error and is inefficient. Demeter makes this process seamless and repeatable by providing gridded land use and land cover change (LULCC) products derived directly from an IAM\u2014in this case, the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM)\u2014in a variety of formats and resolutions commonly used by ESMs.",
