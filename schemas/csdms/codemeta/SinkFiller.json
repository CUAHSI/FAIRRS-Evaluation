    "description": "Uses the Barnes et al (2014) algorithms to replace pits in a topography with flats, or optionally with very shallow gradient surfaces to allow continued draining.\n\nThis component is NOT intended for use iteratively as a model runs; rather, it is to fill in an initial topography. If you want to repeatedly fill pits as a landscape develops, you are after the LakeMapperBarnes component. If you want flow paths on your filled landscape, manually run a FlowDirector and FlowAccumulator for yourself.\n\nThe locations and depths etc. of the fills will be tracked, and properties are provided to access this information.",
