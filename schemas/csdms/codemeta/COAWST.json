    "description": "The COAWST model (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport) is a numerical modeling system that integrates different physical processes to simulate the interaction between the ocean, atmosphere, waves, and sediment transport in coastal environments. COAWST is designed to study complex coastal systems and their responses to various natural and human-induced forces, such as storms, sea level rise, and sediment dynamics.",
