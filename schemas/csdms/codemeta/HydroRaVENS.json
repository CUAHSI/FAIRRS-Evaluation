    "description": "RaVENS: Rain and Variable Evapotranspiration, Nieve, and Streamflow\n\nSimple \"conceptual\" hydrological model that may include an arbitrary number of linked linear reservoirs (soil-zone water, groundwater, etc.) as well as snowpack (accumulation from precipitation with T<0; positive-degree-day melt) and evapotranspiration (from external input or Thorntwaite equation).\n\nIt also includes a water-balance component to adjust ET (typically the least known input) to ensure that P - Q - ET = 0 over the course of a water year.\n\nOther components plot data and compute the NSE (Nash\u2013Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient).",
