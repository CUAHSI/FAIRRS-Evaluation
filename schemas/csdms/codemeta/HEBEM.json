    "description": "The Hydrologically Enhanced Basin Evolution Model (HEBEM) is a combined hydrologic/geomorphic model. The hydrologic model simulates precipitation with variability, infiltration, evapotranspiration, overland flow, and groundwater flow, thus producing a spatially and temporally varying water discharge Q that drives fluvial processes in the land surface. The geomorphic model accounts for tectonic forcing, hillslope processes, erosion, and sediment transport. The combined model uses multiple time steps for hydrologic and geomorphic processes. Due to its hydrologic representation, the model is able to investigate the interaction between hydrology and geomorpholgy.",
