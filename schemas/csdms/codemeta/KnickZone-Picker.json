    "description": "--- WHEN USING THIS CODE FOR YOUR RESEARCH, PLEASE CITE: ---<br>\nNeely, A., Bookhagen B., Burbank, D.W. (2017): An automated knickzone selection algorithm (KZ-Picker) to analyze transient landscapes: Calibration and validation, JGR Earth Surface, doi:10.1002/2017JF004250\navailable at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JF004250/full\n<br>\n---\n\nThe Matlab-based scripts extract several topometrics at the catchment scale based on log area/log slope and chi plots. Topometrics include: steepness index, theta, steepness index with adjusted theta for each drainage basin, specific stream power, curvature, local relief, and others. Detrended and normalized chi-squared plots are used to identify river knickpoints. Output is written as GeoTIFF files, shapefiles, and CSV files.\n\nAdditional information, examples, and tutorials are provided on the github page.",
