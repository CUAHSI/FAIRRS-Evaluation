    "description": "The delta-building model DeltaRCM expanded to included vegetation effects. Vegetation colonizes, grows, and dies, and influences the delta through increasing bank stability and providing resistance to flow. Vegetation was implemented to represent marsh grass type plants, and parameters of stem diameter, carrying capacity, logistic growth rate, and rooting depth can be altered.",
