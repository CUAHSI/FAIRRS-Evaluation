    "description": "This model calculates the long profile of a river with a gravel-sand transition. The model uses two grain sizes: size Dg for gravel and size Ds for sand. The river is assumed to be in flood for the fraction of time Ifg for the gravel-bed reach and fraction Ifs for the sand-bed reach.  All sediment transport is assumed to take place when the river is in flood.\n\nGravel transport is computed using the Parker (1979) approximation of the Einstein (1950) bedload transport relation. Sand transport is computed using the total bed material transport relation of Engelund and Hansen (1967).\n\nIn this simple model the gravel is not allowed to abrade. Both the gravel-bed and sand-bed reaches carry the same flood discharge Qbf.\n\nGravel is transported as bed material in, and deposits only in the gravel-bed reach.  A small residual of gravel load is incorporated into the sand at the gravel-sand transition. Sand is transported as washload in the gravel-bed reach, and as bed material load in the sand-bed reach.\n\nThe model allows for depositional widths Bdgrav and Bdsand that are wider than the corresponding bankfull channel widths Bgrav and Bsand of the gravel-bed and sand-bed channels. As the channel aggrades, it is assumed to migrate and avulse to deposit sediment across the entire depositional width.  For each unit of gravel deposited in the gravel-bed reach, it is assumed that Lamsg units of sand are deposited.  For each unit of sand deposited on the sand-bed reach, it is assumed that Lamms units of mud are deposited.\n\nThe gravel-bed reach has sinuosity Omegag and the sand-bed reach has sinuosity Omegas.\n\nBed resistance is computed through the use of two specified constant Chezy resistance coefficients; Czg for the gravel-bed reach and Czs for the sand-bed reach.",
