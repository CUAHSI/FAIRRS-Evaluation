    "description": "SedCas was developed for a debris-flow prone catchment in the Swiss Alps (Illgraben). It consists of two connected sediment reservoirs on the hillslope and in the channel, where sediment transfer is driven by (lumped) hydrological processes at the basin scale. Sediment is stochastically produced by shallow landslides and rock avalanches and delivered to the hillslope and channel reservoirs. From there, it is evacuated out of the basin in the form of debris flows and sediment-laden floods.",
