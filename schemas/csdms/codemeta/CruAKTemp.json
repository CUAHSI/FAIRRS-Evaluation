    "description": "CruAKtemp is a python 2.7 package that is a data component which serves to provide onthly temperature data over the 20th century for permafrost modeling. The original dataset at higher resolution can be found here:\nhttp://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-monthly-and-derived-temperature-products-771m-cru-ts\nThe geographical extent of this CRUAKtemp dataset has been reduced to greatly reduce the number of ocean or Canadian pixels. Also, the spatial resolution has been reduced by a factor of 13 in each direction, resulting in an effective pixel resolution of about 10km.\nThe data are monthly average temperatures for each month from January 1901 through December 2009.",
