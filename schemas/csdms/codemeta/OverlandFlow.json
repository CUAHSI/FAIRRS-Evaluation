    "description": "The Landlab OverlandFlow component is based on a simplified inertial approximation of the shallow water equations, following the solution of de Almeida et al. (2012). This explicit two-dimensional hydrodynamic algorithm simulates a flood wave across a model domain, where water discharge and flow depth are calculated at all locations within a structured (raster) grid. This component generates a hydrograph at all grid locations, and allows for flow to move in one of the four cardinal directions (D4) into/out of a given model node.",
