    "description": "olaFlow (formerly known as olaFoam) is a numerical model conceived as a continuation of the work in IHFOAM. Its development has been continuous from ihFoam (Jul 8, 2014 - Feb 11, 2016) and olaFoam (Mar 2, 2016 - Nov 25, 2017).\n\nThis free and open source project is committed to bringing the latest advances in the simulation of wave dynamics to the OpenFOAM\u00ae and FOAM-extend communities.\n\nolaFlow includes a set of solvers and boundary conditions to generate and absorb water waves actively at the boundaries and to simulate their interaction with porous coastal structures.",
