    "description": "The model uses the vertically continuous (not active layer-based), morphodynamic framework proposed by Parker, Paola an Leclair in 2000 to model the streamwise and vertical dispersal of a patch of tracers installed in a equilibrium gravel bed. The model was validated at laboratory and field scales on the mountainous Halfmoon Creek, USA, and on the braided Buech River, France.\nDifferent versions of the model are uploaded in the github folder because the formulaiton for the calculation of the formative bed shear stress varied depending on the available data. \n\nREFERENCE\nParker, G., Paola, C. & Leclair, S.
