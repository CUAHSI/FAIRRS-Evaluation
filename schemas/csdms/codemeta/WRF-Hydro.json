    "description": "The Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) was developed as a community-based, open source, model coupling framework designed to link multi-scale process models of the atmosphere and terrestrial hydrology to provide:\n\nAn extensible multi-scale & multi-physics land-atmosphere modeling capability for conservative, coupled and uncoupled assimilation & prediction of major water cycle components such as: precipitation, soil moisture, snow pack, ground water, streamflow, and inundation\nAccurate and reliable streamflow prediction across scales (from 0-order headwater catchments to continental river basins and from minutes to seasons)\nA research modeling testbed for evaluating and improving physical process and coupling representations.",
