    "description": "Life evolves alongside landscapes by biotic and abiotic processes under complex dynamics at Earth\u2019s surface. Researchers who wish to explore these dynamics can use this component as a tool for them to build landscape-life evolution models. Landlab components, including SpeciesEvolver are designed to work with a shared model grid. Researchers can build novel models using plug-and-play surface process components to evolve the grid\u2019s landscape alongside the life tracked by SpeciesEvolver. The simulated life evolves following customizable processes.",
