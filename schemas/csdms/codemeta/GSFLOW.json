    "description": "GSFLOW was a coupled model based on the integration of the U.S. Geological Survey Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS, Leavesley and others, 1983) and the U.S. Geological Survey Modular Groundwater Flow Model(MODFLOW-2005, Harbaugh, 2005). It was developed to simulate coupled groundwater/surface-water flow in one or more watersheds by simultaneously simulating flow across the land surface, within subsurface saturated and unsaturated materials, and within streams and lakes.",
