    "description": "HYPE is a semi-distributed hydrological model for water and water quality. It simulates water and nutrient concentrations in the landscape at the catchment scale. Its spatial division is related to catchments and sub-catchments, land use or land cover, soil type and elevation. Within a catchment the model will simulate different compartments; soil including shallow groundwater, rivers and lakes. It is a dynamical model forced with time series of precipitation and air temperature, typically on a daily time step. Forcing in the form of nutrient loads is not dynamical. Example includes atmospheric deposition, fertilizers and waste water.",
