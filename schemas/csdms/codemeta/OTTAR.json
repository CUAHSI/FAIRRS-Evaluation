    "description": "Transiently evolving river-channel width as a function of streambank properties, sediment in transport, and the hydrograph.\n\nThis model is designed to compute the rates of river-channel widening and narrowing based on changing hydrological regimes. It is currently designed for rivers with cohesive banks, with a critical shear stress for particle detachment and an erosion-rate coefficient.\n\nOTTAR contains:\n* The RiverWidth class, which contains methods to evolve the width of an alluvial river.\n* The FlowDepthDoubleManning class, which is used to estimate flow depth from discharge, even with an evolving river-channel geometry.",
