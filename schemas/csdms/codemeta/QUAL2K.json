    "description": "QUAL2K (or Q2K) is a river and stream water quality model that is intended to represent a modernized version of the QUAL2E (or Q2E) model (Brown and Barnwell 1987). Q2K is similar to Q2E in the following respects:\nOne dimensional. The channel is well-mixed vertically and laterally.\n* Steady state hydraulics. Non-uniform, steady flow is simulated.\n* Diurnal heat budget. The heat budget and temperature are simulated as a function of meteorology on a diurnal time scale.\n* Diurnal water-quality kinetics. All water quality variables are simulated on a diurnal time scale.\n* Heat and mass inputs. Point and non-point loads and abstractions are simulated.",
