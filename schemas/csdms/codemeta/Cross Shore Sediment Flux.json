    "description": "The Cross-Shore Sediment Flux model addresses predominately sandy, wave-dominated coastlines on time-scales ranging from years to millenia and on spatial scales ranging from kilometers to tens of kilometers using a range of wave parameters as inputs. It calculates the cross-shore sediment flux using both shallow water wave assumptions and full Linear Airy wave Theory. An equilibrium profile is also created. Using the Exner equation, we develop an advection diffusion equation that describes the evolution of profile through time. A morphodynamic depth of closure can be estimated for each input wave parameter.",
