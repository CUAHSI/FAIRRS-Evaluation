    "description": "The Spectral Element Ocean Model (SEOM) solves the hydrostatic, and alternatively the non-hydrostatic, primitive equations using a mixed spectral / finite element solution procedure. Potential advantages of the spectral element method include flexible incorporation of complex geometry and spatially dependent resolution, rapid convergence, and attractive performance on parallel computer systems. A 2D version of SEOM, which solves the shallow water equations, has been extensively tested on applications ranging from global tides to the abyssal circulation of the Eastern Mediterranean. The 3D SEOM is undergoing initial testing for later release.",
