    "description": "iHydroSlide3D v1.0 is a physically based modeling framework that accounts for both hydrological and geotechnical processes. The model mainly includes the following modules: (i) a distributed hydrological model based on the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model, (ii) a newly developed 3D landslide model, and (iii) a soil moisture downscaling method.",
