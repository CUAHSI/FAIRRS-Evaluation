    "description": "Derived from MOSART-WM (Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport with Water Management), mosasrtwmpy is a large-scale river-routing Python model used to study riverine dynamics of water, energy, and biogeochemistry cycles across local, regional, and global scales. The water management component represents river regulation through reservoir storage and release operations, diversions from reservoir releases, and allocation to sectoral water demands. The model allows an evaluation of the impact of water management over multiple river basins at once (global and continental scales) with consistent representation of human operations over the full domain.",
