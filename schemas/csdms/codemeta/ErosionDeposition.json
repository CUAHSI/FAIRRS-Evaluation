    "description": "The Landlab ErosionDeposition component calculates fluvial erosion and deposition of a single substrate as derived by Davy and Lague (2009, Journal of Geophysical Research). Mass is simultaneously conserved in two reservoirs: the bed and the water column. ErosionDeposition dynamically transitions between detachment-limited and transport-limited behavior, but is limited to erosion of a single substrate (e.g., sediment or bedrock but not both).",
