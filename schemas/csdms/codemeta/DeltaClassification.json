    "description": "This tool provides a method for extracting information on the nature and spatial extent of active geomorphic processes across deltas from the geometry of islands and the channels around them using machine learning. \nThe method consists of a two-step ensemble unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters islands into spatially continuous zones based on morphological metrics computed on remotely sensed imagery",
