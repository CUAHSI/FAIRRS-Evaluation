    "description": "Landlab is a Python software package for creating, assembling, and/or running 2D numerical models. Landlab was created to facilitate modeling in earth-surface dynamics, but it is general enough to support a wide range of applications. Landlab provides three different capabilities:\n\n(1) A DEVELOPER'S TOOLKIT for efficiently building 2D models from scratch. The toolkit includes a powerful GRIDDING ENGINE for creating, managing, and iterative updating data on 2D structured or unstructured grids. The toolkit also includes helpful utilities to handle model input and output.\n\n(2) A set of pre-built COMPONENTS, each of which models a particular process. Components can be combined together to create coupled models.\n\n(3) A library of pre-built MODELS that have been created by combining components together.\n\n To learn more, please visit http://landlab.github.io",
