    "description": "Shoreline is a \"line model\" for modeling the evolution of a coastline as the result of wind/wave-driven longshore sediment transport. It is based on conservation of mass and a semi-empirical sediment transport formula known as the CERC formula. This model was specifically adapted for modeling the evolution of the coastline near Barrow, Alaska.",
